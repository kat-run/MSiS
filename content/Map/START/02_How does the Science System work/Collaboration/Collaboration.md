**Abstract/Summary**

Collaboration has always been a hallmark of the scientific endeavor and with the rise of scientific activity, has been steadily growing in scale, scope and importance. Collaborations in science can be characterized with many different terms. They can be intra-disciplinary (staying within the same discipline), inter-disciplinary (between different disciplines), or they can even be, multi- or trans disciplinary(for more details see [[Inter- and Transdisciplinarity]]); there is collaboration between Universities and private entities (so called research-industry partnership, or [[Technology Transfer and Academic Capitalism]]), or collaboration between researchers or lay-people ([[Citizen Science]]). In summary, collaboration is as diverse as the scientific ecosystem and the questions that contemporary science is set to answer: ‚Äúmost practical problems do not emerge ready-made in the middle of existing research specialties. They are essentially _transdisciplinary‚Äù_ ([Ziman, 2000](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Ziman-2000-c3cc23cb876c4dbe8f10ecda135a072d?pvs=21)).

A measure for the rising collaborative efforts of science are bibliographic data on authorship of scientific publications. Research papers with more than one author have been increasing in all disciplines, including the humanities, and are generally cited more often than single-authored papers ([Cronin, 2005](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Cronin-2005-05e9345aa0154f15b560b8939805ed76?pvs=21)). Especially in the natural sciences, author lists tend to get longer and longer, culminating in disciplines like particle physics, where large-scale projects often involve thousands of scientists. In 2015, for instance, a [paper with more than 5000 authors](https://www-nature-com.libproxy.unibz.it/articles/nature14474), working on the Higgs-Boson at CERN, was published in _Nature_

Like any activity involving multiple people, also in collaborative science projects, the need for roles who perform tasks outside of the core mission (i.e. knowledge production) grows with the size of the collaboration effort. Administrative and managerial tasks like scheduling meetings, setting common goals and timelines and data management need to be carried out. Unique to scientific collaboration however is the epistemic ecosystem in which collaborations are carried out and which has to be respected. Processes like peer review, disciplinary paradigms, methodology, research policy, etc. have to be respected and considered ([Sonnenwald, 2007](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Sonnenwald-2007-61dd1b0ec8f440ca9281e612a21fb9fb?pvs=21)) Hence, the larger the collaborative effort, the more social aspects play a role.

Note, that scientific questions are only a small part of the collaborative process. Hence, it is important to consider all of these factors, not just the scientific ones, before starting a scientific collaboration

Research on scientific collaboration is interdisciplinary in and of itself. Contributions by Sociology, Science and technology Studies (STS), Philosophy of Science, Organizational Studies, Communication Science, Psychology etc. have contributed to the theoretical backing, have researched practical implications and problems of scientific collaboration and have assessed the outcomes of various collaborative endeavors. ‚ÄúAssessing the scientific and societal impact of team-based research, though challenging, is critical to ensure science policies and practices maximize our investments in science. Limited resources have also led to the production of studies that have used convenience samples, or that have evaluated a single program‚Äù [Hall et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Hall-et-al-2018-a1ce80b1f50243afaeb001e6b412734e?pvs=21).
