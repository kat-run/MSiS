**Abstract/Summary**

Even though mobility has to some extent always been a feature of academic pursuit ([Fran√ßa & Padilla, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fran-a-Padilla-2017-0f528790e3fb47fc9cc85afe95810f6d?pvs=21)), the last years have seen an increasing internationalization of the scientific workforce in academia and beyond [Bonaccorsi & Biancardi, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bonaccorsi-Biancardi-2021-f435ee2a029f49d7885c5fda71ede666?pvs=21). This push does not only come from the scientific community itself, it has also been favored through policy decisions, for instance from the EU with transnational funding and fellowships (i.e. the [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) fellowship program). The process of international exchange has been termed ‚ÄúBrain Circulation‚Äù and has become an important factor in countries‚Äô knowledge economies, with countries competing for talents (‚Äùbrain drain‚Äù and ‚Äúbrain gain‚Äù) [Daugeliene & Marcinkeviciene, 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Daugeliene-Marcinkeviciene-2009-87949fb0db5b42d981f9497e3f767e43?pvs=21).

Indeed, enhanced international [[Collaboration]] in scientific research offers many advantages, such as knowledge exchange, network building and reduction of experimental efforts through distribution of tasks. Ideally, this exchange is favorable for both the researchers and their institutions: ‚ÄúResearchers are expected to move through institutions, building their careers and transmitting the benefits of their experience to new groups or teams. The most successful researchers are assumed to be the most mobile, moving between postdoctoral positions in their early careers, to set up research groups of their own, in different institutions‚Äù ([Kerr & Lorenz-Meyer, 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Kerr-Lorenz-Meyer-2009-398532ce149742bc92032e73282b18e6?pvs=21), p.145f).

Especially in recent years, mobility and international experience have not only become assets for building a solid academic career but prerequisites([Felt, 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2009-4b01db7985ca4360aed03035391f0696?pvs=21) [Loveday, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Loveday-2018-1bdc92e584814e1aa0668ec78ce340e6?pvs=21)). One of the maim criteria in an applicant‚Äôs CV for the few permanent positions in academia (see also [[Changes in the Academic Workforce - tenure, projectification and part-time]]), is time spent abroad in different institutions or universities. Additionally, employment across different national contexts and disciplines necessitates metrics to compare candidates. It elevates the relyance on such -often inadequate- [[Metrics and Indicators]] and this, in turn, exerts tacit governance effects on how junior researchers plan their careers and research trajectories, as well as choose and carry out their research ([Felt, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2017-cbcdcb1df1244a3d83f4531b2091d9c3?pvs=21) [Fochler et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fochler-et-al-2016-ad0d5bd0a02b4a6dbd76470719c25638?pvs=21))

However, besides its many benefits for exchange, community building and knowledge production, mobility as a requirement in academic careers, is also contributing to already existing systemic inequalities and disfavors different people in various ways: "While the benefits brought by academic mobility are undeniable, the fact that its concept, nature and structure is built up on male oriented rules based on unequal gender configurations, turns out to reinforce pre-existing inequalities and power asymmetries, reinforcing further women‚Äôs exclusion in the academic sector‚Äù ([Fran√ßa & Padilla, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fran-a-Padilla-2017-0f528790e3fb47fc9cc85afe95810f6d?pvs=21), p. 51).

Firstly, internationalization and a high degree of mobility often comes at the expense of the people who are living this lifestyle [Giorgi & Raffini, 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Giorgi-Raffini-2015-edbc89a6c8ff4befb9b309971bb9ac83?pvs=21). Researchers are required to quickly adapt and be productive in new situations, often to the detriment of their mental health and their social life: ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs epistemic living space ‚Äì what it is to live and work in science ‚Äì may shift quite profoundly as one moves from one context to another. The practice of science may look and feel very different, requiring a period of enculturation; an enculturation that is intertwined with but not confined to the personal challenges of moving to a new country. Existing research in international mobility has noted experiences of isolation or ‚Äòhomelessness‚Äô‚Äù ([Davies, 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-2020-72aab3caf7ee49fa8e6a9a904f98ced3?pvs=21), p. 111)

Additionally, not everybody can be mobile and available at all times. People who have obligations outside the professional realm, for instance care for children or relatives, or care for a household and partner often cannot have the same level of mobility as individuals free of such obligations. This is often especially felt by women, for whom the phase that requires the most mobility and the phase where many think about starting a family coincide ([Fran√ßa & Padilla, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fran-a-Padilla-2017-0f528790e3fb47fc9cc85afe95810f6d?pvs=21), see also [[Care Work in Academia]]).

Similarly, due to preexisting societal prejudices which are also reflected in academia, researchers from the global south or from marginalized communities are often disfavored from obtaining positions at universities, contributing to the already unequal conditions that these communities have ([Mart√≠n Rojo, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mart-n-Rojo-2021-bde3642684d749d49f923cb64f92ca82?pvs=21))

Besides cementing certain pre-existing inequalities, academic mobility has also different implications for mobile researchers from different national contexts. [Morley et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Morley-et-al-2018-25697c8ab1ad425786de563021e5cca1?pvs=21) describe, how the narrative of the international researcher affects people coming from marginalized communities and/or the global south, including feelings of ‚Äúotherness‚Äù in a foreign country, a consequence of which is isolation. However most importantly, internationalization of research often does not imply an exchange of different knowledges and research traditions but an imposition of the already dominant (western) way of doing things:‚ÄùIn some academic settings, migrant academics may feel more like knowledge workers than knowledge producers, constrained to absorb the local ways of (re)producing knowledge instead of actively contributing to creating it. This suggests that the circulation of knowledge in the global economy through internationalization of higher education might be more limited than assumed‚Äù ([Morley et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Morley-et-al-2018-ecc66c5d9d7c46acbd24add2e9f1c579?pvs=21) p.550).

In conclusion, while the internationalization of knowledge and knowledge workers has brought many positive aspects to science and society in general and is highly desired by policy makers and institutions, it is important not to overlook the toll that mobility has on the knowledge workers themselves ([Giorgi & Raffini, 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Giorgi-Raffini-2015-edbc89a6c8ff4befb9b309971bb9ac83?pvs=21)), especially on a systemic level with marginalized groups and women often being systemically disfavored. Mobility as a requirement for academic careers in combination with a rising [[The Marketization of Science]]often cements already pre-existing power inequalities, both in terms of people but also in terms of knowledge, and makes science overall a less equitable endeavor.
