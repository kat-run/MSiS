### Transformation research: towards a new research field

As the urgency of addressing social and ecological crises such as climate change and biodiversity loss has intensified, the call for researchers to partake more actively in crafting concrete solutions to these and other societal problems has increased. Against this backdrop, transformation research has emerged as a new research perspective aiming to ‚Äústudy complex and pervasive societal problems and to search and support long-term and fundamental societal change processes and dynamics towards sustainability‚Äù ([Wittmayer et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wittmayer-et-al-2018-fa32a293d1934e8084944030fdd1d5f6?pvs=21), p. 9). Various empirical and theoretical approaches have been developed in recent years, accompanied by a lively debate on adequate research methods to study and support a sustainability transformation. However, transformation research does not (yet) constitute an established or closed research field. Rather, it can be characterized as a new perspective in which various existing research directions and approaches converge, bringing together a variety of different thematic foci, concepts, methods and frameworks. As of today, the most important contributions stem from transition research, specific subsets of social-ecological or sustainability research, social innovation research, resilience research, political or social ecology and ecological economics as well as individual contributions from disciplines like sociology, political science, psychology and future studies ([Haum & Pilardeaux, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haum-Pilardeaux-2014-c53a442d448a40e6b3617c89a6f67974?pvs=21) [Patterson et al., 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Patterson-et-al-2015-9b7786aa80964beeb81fc9ad309faa65?pvs=21) ).

Most of the research in question revolves around three overarching topics shedding light on different aspects of transformation: the objects of transformation (i.e., what is/ought to be changing), the dynamics of transformation processes and emergent pathways (i.e., how do processes of change unfold) and the drivers of transformative change (i.e., how and by whom/what are transformation processes initiated and supported) ([Wittmayer et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wittmayer-et-al-2018-fa32a293d1934e8084944030fdd1d5f6?pvs=21) ). In addition, four cornerstones of transformation research have been identified which help to map out some of its central requirements and thereby allow to better demarcate this emerging perspective (Ibid.).

Firstly, transformation research involves an explicit normative orientation, as it aims to study and address concrete and pressing societal issues which are connected to radical change (e.g., the de-carbonisation of the energy sector). However, while it is generally agreed on that, for the current multiple crises to be adequately tackled, fundamental and radical change is required, what exactly this radicality implies is contested. Similarly, the normative orientation towards sustainability as an overarching guiding principle is a common denominator within transformation research, even though there is no unanimous interpretation of what sustainability actually means[1]. While normativity plays a central role, it is not necessarily the case that transformation research is more normative than other types of research ([Grunwald, 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Grunwald-2015-5fbd467886c04634b6b0a9dfb63c4427?pvs=21)). Instead, what sets it apart from traditional research approaches, e.g., in economics or engineering, is that it makes its own normativity more explicit.

The engagement with complex real-world problems, which are interdisciplinary by nature, implies, secondly, a prominent role for inter- and transdisciplinary research approaches. Indeed, the importance of involving more than one scientific discipline as well as social actors to better understand the problem at hand and explore possible solutions has been championed in the transformation literature ([WGBU, 2011](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/WGBU-2011-cd7117e0a0d0408390bb27437f011524?pvs=21) [Haum & Pilardeaux, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haum-Pilardeaux-2014-c53a442d448a40e6b3617c89a6f67974?pvs=21) [Wiek & Lang, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wiek-Lang-2016-1321e1731c5047caba05217876dd5d32?pvs=21) [Brandt et al., 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Brandt-et-al-2013-7b0ce7d885084403afca1226092f1eda?pvs=21) ) ‚Äì though not without controversy ([Strohschneider, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Strohschneider-2014-9e91cdfa53794166aeeefbde4336ebf5?pvs=21) ). The emphasis on creating transdisciplinary spaces to bring together diverse actors, problem perceptions, values and types of knowledge to work on pressing societal issues is in line with the conception of transformation as a societal search, learning and experimentation process ([Rei√üig, 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Rei-ig-2009-a64a4dfc4f99486d9a5027c8933c6f32?pvs=21) [Grin et al., 2011](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Grin-et-al-2011-cbaf3874fd12409e99c59802817945af?pvs=21)).

Thirdly, in analogy to the two-fold goal of transformation research of contributing to a better understanding of transformation processes and actively shaping and supporting them, two broad research approaches can be identified: a descriptive-analytical and a transformative approach ([Wittmayer et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wittmayer-et-al-2018-fa32a293d1934e8084944030fdd1d5f6?pvs=21)). This distinction resembles debates on ‚Äúpost-normal science‚Äù (Funtowicz & Ravetz 1993), ‚ÄúMode 2 knowledge production‚Äù ([Gibbons et al., 1994](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gibbons-et-al-1994-df2687bfde294e23ab090d6687b61803?pvs=21) ) and the more established approach of ‚Äúaction research‚Äù ([Greenwood & Levin, 2007](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Greenwood-Levin-2007-383b00ed9ef34f4180e96fbe4eeb06bf?pvs=21) ). A descriptive-analytical approach is primarily interested in describing, analyzing and explaining existing challenges as well as past processes of social change, while also providing insights on possible solution strategies, mainly through the production of conceptual knowledge. A transformative approach, instead, is more solution- and process-oriented, striving to search for and help implement solutions to concrete societal problems. In doing so, it is open to a variety of scientific and non-scientific actors and types of knowledge, which are typically integrated through a transdisciplinary, participatory research design directed towards the co-development of actionable knowledge[3]. The descriptive-analytical and the transformative research approach can be considered as two poles characterising different ways to approach a set of research questions within the broader frame of transformation research. In practice, combinations and overlaps between the two approaches are possible and quite common.

Finally, in light of the increasing transcendence of traditional boundaries between science and society, there is an ongoing debate on quality criteria for transformation research. While some argue that clear, incontestable criteria to assess the quality of transdisciplinary research may no longer be available and instead call for an openness to a plurality of definitions of quality (e.g. [NOWOTNY et al., 2003](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/NOWOTNY-et-al-2003-aeaba5860422474d978c62e99fbce289?pvs=21) ), others stress the importance of identifying and adhering to generalized quality criteria also within transdisciplinary and transformative research approaches (e.g. [Schneidewind & Singer-Brodowski, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schneidewind-Singer-Brodowski-2013-cbbccccbcd4d480db6c95f41b3bf4253?pvs=21) ). Some provisional criteria that have been discussed in this context are the scientific and the social impact as well as the credibility or trustworthiness of the research and its results (see, e.g., [Bergmann et al., 2005](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bergmann-et-al-2005-9ac39ad9297c4fd5bb84d131d2e68b42?pvs=21) , [Schwartz-Shea, 2006](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schwartz-Shea-2006-a5cd4fb9974b46f1b98e6c5ee17dd8dd?pvs=21) [Greenwood & Levin, 2007](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Greenwood-Levin-2007-383b00ed9ef34f4180e96fbe4eeb06bf?pvs=21) ). Beyond these outcome-related factors, also the transparency about research goals, approaches, methods and procedures (see, e.g., [Cash et al., 2002](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Cash-et-al-2002-8ad380e80e984ec2a5a7373aaccd509f?pvs=21), [Schwartz-Shea, 2006](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schwartz-Shea-2006-a5cd4fb9974b46f1b98e6c5ee17dd8dd?pvs=21) ) as well as the reflexivity employed in the research process ‚Äì implying, among other things, critically reflecting on the epistemological and normative assumptions involved, the relationship between the researchers and the researched as well as the situatedness of the researchers and the research itself (see, e.g., [Finlay, 2002](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Finlay-2002-3600f05e5a094d949db7e43b0eefe70c?pvs=21) [Schwartz-Shea, 2006](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schwartz-Shea-2006-a5cd4fb9974b46f1b98e6c5ee17dd8dd?pvs=21) [Stirling, 2006](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Stirling-2006-ba187bc8fedd41259eacf6c8316dab23?pvs=21)) ‚Äì have been stressed.

However, as hinted at in the previous section, there remain substantive epistemological, methodological and methodical questions, especially when it comes to participatory approaches in transdisciplinary contexts. Regarding the last point, [Wittmayer et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wittmayer-et-al-2018-fa32a293d1934e8084944030fdd1d5f6?pvs=21) (70-82) have offered a useful starting point for reflection by providing an overview of social science methods within transformation research that can be used for data collection (e.g., experiments, participant observation, Delphi method), data analysis (e.g., grounded theory, conflict analysis, social network analysis) and participatory frameworks (e.g., transition management, communities of practice, living labs).

Other future challenges for transformation research include navigating the plurality of research foci, concepts and frameworks ‚Äì which is considered one of its core strengths ‚Äì by clearly delineating the epistemological and ontological differences between various research strands while also strengthening a common conceptual ground. This includes sharpening the understanding of key concepts like transformation and transformative change in order to reduce the risk of the terms becoming mere buzzwords that are easily co-opted and increase their analytical value. What is more, fostering practices of critical (self-)reflection regarding the research process and its results will be central to increasing the legitimacy and accountability of transformative research. Finally, in order to further strengthen and refine transformation research, also the scientific system in which transformative research practices are embedded would need to be transformed, including current funding structures, established quality criteria and academic curricula ([Wittmayer et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wittmayer-et-al-2018-fa32a293d1934e8084944030fdd1d5f6?pvs=21) ).
