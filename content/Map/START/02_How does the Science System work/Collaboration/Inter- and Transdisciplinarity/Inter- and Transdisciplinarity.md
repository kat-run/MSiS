### Science under transformation: from discipline-based to inter- and transdisciplinary research

Science and technology play a key role in modern societies. Many of the problems and crises faced by these societies cannot be overcome without the contribution of scientific and technical expertise. One reason for this is that modern societies are increasingly designed and built on the basis of scientific knowledge and technical artifacts. Scientific knowledge becomes a foundation for political decisions and technological innovations that shape people's lives. Against this background, scientific disciplines no longer see their task solely in solving purely scientific problems, but increasingly also in dealing with the real-world problems of modern societies. In this sense, the disciplinary boundaries of scientific research are being _transcended_ in order to deal with issues that lie beyond them: Research is becoming increasingly _transdisciplinary_.

Transdisciplinary research has gained prominence in addressing complex global challenges since the 1990s, particularly concerning issues like climate change and sustainability ([Brandt et al., 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Brandt-et-al-2013-c8cdb6e8139f43efb410d302fc7d8745?pvs=21) [Gro√ü & Stauffacher, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gro-Stauffacher-2014-b4424007e3a447f49ced7ad8685a734b?pvs=21)). This approach is crucial for tackling "wicked problems", which resist simple solutions and demand holistic, collaborative approaches. The multiple and heterogeneous nature of current crises underscores the necessity of methods that transcend disciplinary boundaries as these challenges span scientific, social, economic, and policy dimensions and cannot be adequately addressed within the confines of individual disciplines.

J√ºrgen Mittelstra√ü ([Mittelstra√ü, 1992](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mittelstra-1992-78cd93708c284b278bf1d601477223d8?pvs=21) [Mittelstra√ü, 2005](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mittelstra-2005-fd3d47115452467c96edc139ec8eb0c6?pvs=21)) presented an early concept of transdisciplinarity. Transdisciplinarity presents itself as a form of scientific research, where the aim is to solve _non-scientific problems_ (e.g., environmental problems). In this sense, transdisciplinarity is a _principle_ of research that enters the scene _where it is not possible to define problems and solutions solely in disciplinary or specialist terms_ or where it goes beyond such definitions. For Mittelstra√ü, research is transdisciplinary when scientific disciplines no longer deal with objects and problems that belong to the canon of their discipline, but with objects and problems that point beyond it and require cooperation with other disciplines. For Mittelstra√ü, transdisciplinary research is therefore nothing other than genuine interdisciplinary research: i.e. interdisciplinary cooperation in relation to transdisciplinary problems. In the absence of this fundamental reference to transdisciplinary problems, Mittelstra√ü speaks of multidisciplinarity, i.e., the situation in which different disciplines research the same topic separately from each other without transcending their disciplinary problems to a common, transdisciplinary problem. While multidisciplinary efforts can contribute valuable insights from individual disciplines, they may lack the integration and synthesis required to fully understand and address the multifaceted nature of contemporary challenges.

The crucial point here is that Mittelstra√ü ‚Äì following the classic understanding of science, founded on the strict distinction between (scientific) facts and (societal) values ‚Äì argues for science to address social problems, but that it should remain within the boundaries of scientific research when doing so. In other words, science should deal with social problems, but non-scientific knowledge should not be involved. Rather, science should work in interdisciplinary cooperation to define problems and develop solutions, which will then serve as a basis for political decision-making.

Mittelstra√ü thus argues for a relationship between science and politics that can be conceived as a ‚Äúdeficit model‚Äù. The deficit model, in the context of the relationship between science and the public, is a conceptual framework that assumes a lack of scientific knowledge or understanding among the public. According to this model, it is believed that public skepticism or resistance to scientific findings is primarily due to a deficit in knowledge or understanding on the part of the public. The deficit model suggests that if people were adequately informed about scientific facts, they would accept and support the scientific consensus.

In the context of science and politics, the deficit model is to be interpreted as a ‚Äúlinear model of expertise‚Äù. In this model, there is an assumed linear relationship between science and policy, where scientific experts provide objective and unbiased information, and policymakers use this information to make informed decisions. This model implies a one-way flow of information from scientists to policymakers, with the assumption that scientific facts can and should determine policy outcomes. Furthermore, the linear relationship between science and politics is accompanied by a tendency to transform political questions into epistemic questions. This in turn can lead to a simultaneous depoliticization ([Bogner, 2007](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bogner-2007-afdd7d1bcdb54f6ca086825c6839ac85?pvs=21) ) of democratic-deliberative procedures, as decision-making authority tends to be transferred to a supposed scientific authority (expertocracy); and a (false) politicization of scientific procedures, as political actors and lobby groups tend to occupy the field of science in order to push through political agendas ([Bogner, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bogner-2021-33dcb119f4e44d6fa16254a29738978c?pvs=21)).

However, this model has been widely criticized for oversimplifying the complex relationship between science and politics ([Bijker et al., 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bijker-et-al-2009-cd3d62504f2a42399bc044c3fa3b66bc?pvs=21)). Sheila Jasanoff ([Jasanoff, 2004](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Jasanoff-2004-6df3b366a96049888a1c17ac6ca0990f?pvs=21) [Jasanoff, 2007](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Jasanoff-2007-be8dce0381d64d03adf0c59382f68785?pvs=21)), following Latour, Knorr-Cetina and others, challenges this linear model by highlighting the complex and dynamic interactions between science and politics. She argues that scientific expertise is not value-neutral and is often shaped by societal values, cultural contexts, and political considerations. In the real world, the relationship between science and policy is more iterative and involves negotiation, contestation, and the _co-production_ of knowledge. In particular, Jasanoff's concept of co-production in science underscores the mutual shaping of scientific knowledge and societal values. Rather than seeing science as an objective, value-neutral enterprise, co-production acknowledges that scientific facts are actively constructed through interactions with social, cultural, and political contexts. It involves a collaborative process where scientists, policymakers, the public, and other stakeholders contribute to shaping scientific knowledge, and in turn, this knowledge influences societal values and decision-making. Co-production challenges the traditional view of a linear relationship between science and policy, emphasizing the bidirectional and complex interactions between scientific expertise and the broader sociopolitical landscape as well as an emphasis on the role of _intermediate_ structures and actors ([Meyer & Kearnes, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Meyer-Kearnes-2013-e6e6cdc442d04943be1c22dc13865ae3?pvs=21)) such as boundary organizations ([Guston, 2001](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Guston-2001-a8841232406542b59603d16fd80ec22d?pvs=21) [Miller, 2001](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Miller-2001-4f3a8e8ee1654fe4b022514018252758?pvs=21)).

‚ÄúMode 2 knowledge production‚Äù, as conceptualized by [Gibbons et al., 1994](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gibbons-et-al-1994-df2687bfde294e23ab090d6687b61803?pvs=21) , marks a departure from traditional disciplinary approaches (Mode 1) by adopting a context-driven and problem-solving orientation. Thus, socially robust knowledge ([Nowotny, 2003](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Nowotny-2003-b671d346654c43f4a9ea27178be8ece1?pvs=21)) within Mode 2 distinguishes itself by prioritizing societal relevance, active engagement with various perspectives, and a commitment to addressing practical challenges, in contrast to the more insular and academic focus of Mode 1 knowledge production ([Gibbons, 1999](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gibbons-1999-78666a60c68a44c08975545a26041d63?pvs=21)). This shift reflects a broader transformation in the dynamics and priorities of knowledge creation, emphasizing responsiveness to the complexities of the world and the diverse needs of society. Unlike the more rigid and academic nature of Mode 1 as envisioned by Mittelstra√ü, Mode 2 knowledge is generated collaboratively in real-world settings, involving not only academic researchers but also a diverse array of stakeholders in processes of co-production.

This also involves the concept of "post-normal science". Post-normal science, coined by Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome R. Ravetz ([Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1993](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Funtowicz-Ravetz-1993-5e4bcabc8b4046d1901daef50119f6a0?pvs=21)), describes an approach to scientific inquiry in situations marked by high uncertainty, complexity, and the involvement of diverse societal values. In post-normal science, traditional scientific methods face challenges due to a lack of clear facts and agreed-upon methodologies. Issues addressed in this framework often involve significant ambiguity and a multiplicity of perspectives, requiring decisions that go beyond scientific evidence to consider ethical, social, and political dimensions. The extended peer community, including scientists, policymakers, and the public, collaboratively contributes to the co-production of knowledge and decision-making. Quality assurance in post-normal science involves a reflexive and transparent process that acknowledges uncertainties and contextual factors, challenging the conventional notion of linear and value-neutral scientific inquiry. The framework emphasizes inclusivity and participation to address complex issues that fall outside the scope of "normal" scientific practice.

This calls for a new understanding of transdisciplinary. As with Mittelstra√ü, transdisciplinary research in Mode 2 knowledge production is defined by transcending disciplinary problems to non-scientific and thus real-world problems; in contrast to Mittelstra√ü , however, it is emphasized that ‚Äì especially in situations of high uncertainty and complexity ‚Äì both the identification and formulation of the problems and the way in which they are solved need to be co-produced by the participation of non-scientific actors such as political decision-makers, economic entrepreneurs, affected citizens, patients, users or consumers, rather than by excluding them on dubious epistemological reasons.

Assuming that non-scientific actors should participate in research on social problems and solutions, the question ultimately arises as to the extent to which this participation should occur. Against this background, [Callon, 1999](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Callon-1999-de2e1c2f5b4c4b1bbd70d7f8e29a0fe0?pvs=21) has distinguished three models in which laypeople can relate to science.

1. The first model is the already mentioned ‚Äúdeficit model‚Äù. Trust between laypeople and scientists is crucial in this model, since science claims exclusive right to valid knowledge, but can only do so if this privilege is also granted to it by society. Thus, any mistrust threatens the relationships and the balance between science and society. The solution to mistrust is considered to be intensified educational and informative actions. The legitimacy of political decisions, according to this model, depends on the representativeness of those speaking for citizens and the resources mobilized, guided by scientific knowledge for foreseeing the effects of actions. Political action involves consultation on goals and explanation of realistic possibilities.
2. In the second model, the relationship becomes more intricate. It replaces an undifferentiated public of the first model (i.e., the public as a homogeneous and uninformed mass) with _differentiated publics_ based on diverse conditions such as profession, locality, age, and sex. These publics possess specific, concrete knowledge and competencies, derived from experiences and observations, _enriching_ the abstract knowledge of scientists. Thus, scientific knowledge, though universal, is considered incomplete and deficient due to its abstraction and dependence on rare laboratory conditions. The _complementary relationship between universal and local knowledge_ is exemplified in various contexts, such as drug testing, and sociological analyses by laypeople. This model suggests opening discussions and deliberations to enrich scientific knowledge, emphasizing negotiation of opinions and knowledge, with agreement reached through compromise. In this model, non-scientific knowledge is considered to counter the deficiency that abstract scientific knowledge has in relation to real-world problems. This means that non-scientific knowledge is considered, however, as a form of knowledge that is to be integrated and translated into scientific procedures and is therefore not equivalent to scientific knowledge. This is the case, for example, when it comes to inviting (or not inviting) stakeholders or collecting opinions on problems via surveys. Just as model 1 this model continues to maintain a strict separation between science and society ([Callon & Rabeharisoa, 2003](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Callon-Rabeharisoa-2003-50d309a3a14e4267b0ad96cfc6ca3411?pvs=21)).
3. Model 3, the "co-production of knowledge model," departs from the demarcation obsession seen in Models 1 and 2 by actively involving lay people in the creation of knowledge concerning them. Unlike the exclusive approaches of the first two models, this model recognizes the essential role of non-specialists in knowledge production ([Wynne, 1998](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wynne-1998-a12e88a4b6b54bf9a7abf2c5c5c470c4?pvs=21)). The dynamics involve a constant tension between standardized universal knowledge and knowledge accounting for the complexity of singular local situations, fostering a collaborative process where specialists and non-specialists work closely together. The concept of "concerned" groups replaces differentiated or undifferentiated publics, and collective learning occurs as different forms of knowledge ([Rabeharisoa, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Rabeharisoa-2017-80c10a6d5199485c93ead61dacb549b0?pvs=21) ) mutually transform each other. The model emphasizes the active contribution of lay people or ‚Äúlayexperts‚Äù ([Epstein, 1996](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Epstein-1996-9090d11088524320b3ac4b279cebf454?pvs=21) ), who become an integral part of a hybrid collective or ‚Äúepistemic community‚Äù ([Haas, 1992](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haas-1992-faa274a170fa4b5a914aecb29082a613?pvs=21)), challenging the traditional division of tasks within the learned collective. This participatory dynamic not only allows non-scientists to control _knowledge concerning their conditions_ but also contributes to the construction of new identities and fosters a unique relationship between science and the constructed, negotiated identities of the concerned groups ([Rabeharisoa et al., 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Rabeharisoa-et-al-2014-6a455045eeef4370822d8b7c64951e8c?pvs=21) ). The legitimacy of this joint enterprise depends on the ability of concerned groups to gain recognition for their actions, highlighting the crucial role of financial resources and public involvement in sustaining research and constructing new identities ([Callon et al., 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Callon-et-al-2009-a6a49d891d984609bc722aadba159ebf?pvs=21)).

However, there are several problems and difficulties associated with transdisciplinary and, in particular, participatory approaches. One criticism is that although problem-oriented and context-sensitive research has several advantages, it also means that it is difficult to generalize results beyond their singular context ([Pohl, 2011](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Pohl-2011-3eb7c4963467439984cc8f2dbd3747aa?pvs=21) [Rosendahl et al., 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Rosendahl-et-al-2015-ca82e3cb95464976bc64a1b2b1c7a159?pvs=21)). This poses a problem. Not only is it difficult to transfer what has been learned from individual cases to other cases, it also calls into question one of the prerequisites of scientific knowledge: the reproducibility of findings. It has been pointed out time and again that citizen participation often remains superficial and usually only serves to legitimize existing problems and decisions a priori. The question also arises as to who should/must be involved in participatory processes. On the one hand, such processes must be understood as open processes in which new concerned groups can emerge again and again. On the other hand, the distinction between invited and uninvited participation must be considered, as the latter represent perspectives (e.g., protest movements) that are often ignored in planning and public discussion. In addition, in participatory processes, the question of power usually emerges ([Wehling, 2012](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wehling-2012-c4902de2c02b424080cd3cd2dbd121e1?pvs=21)). There can always be power imbalances, clashing interests and conflicts in these processes, and these are often difficult to reconcile with the knowledge interests of the researchers. This point also refers to the problem of reflexivity, which arises in these procedures due to the direct involvement of the researchers. The relationships that researchers develop with participants and their role as neutral observers (Model 2) or engaged facilitators (Model 3) must therefore be questioned (Herberg 2018). Finally, it should be emphasized that to date there is no elaborated theory of transdisciplinary research in which the relevant epistemological, methodological and methodical questions have been uniformly clarified ([Pohl, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Pohl-2014-fdad11e2d6dc4a598efc08aab99040fa?pvs=21) [Ukowitz, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Ukowitz-2014-4b6e5c007e924a7abc873e516ead8d7a?pvs=21) [Renn, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Renn-2021-ae6791f6c4904c05bfa403cc58b17596?pvs=21)). Even the question of whether such a theory is needed at all is still unresolved ([Mittelstra√ü, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mittelstra-2018-66d9459e28ff42f1a081a25bd9e5b44c?pvs=21)).
