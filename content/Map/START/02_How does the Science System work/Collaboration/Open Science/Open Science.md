**Abstract/Summary**

Open Science Definition: (from [Open Science, Open Access & Open Data, n.d.](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Open-Science-Open-Access-Open-Data-n-d-5d4879deaa3e48cfb0e4f4847f87877a?pvs=21))

Open Science¬†**encompasses a variety of practices**¬†including open access to publications, open raw research data, free software, participatory science, open learning and teaching resources, and¬†**alternative methods for research evaluation, such as open peer review.**

On the institutional level open science has gained growing support when in2012, the Royal Society issued a report, arguing for making research publications and data in order to ‚Äúimprove the conduct of science, respond to changing public expectations and political culture and enable researchers to maximize the impact of their research. They are designed to ensure that reproducibility and self-correction are maintained in an era of massive data volumes. They aim to stimulate the communication and collaboration where these are needed to maximize  
the value of data-intensive approaches to science‚Äù

For advancing open science at every level of scientific knowledge production, Bianca Kramer and Jeroen Bosman [provide](https://zenodo.org/records/1147025) a compendium of 17 open science practices with example tools.

After the initial euphoria about opening up the scientific process, the concept and developments of open science have also drawn a considerable amount of criticism by scholars like Philip Mirowski (2018): ‚Äúwhen one looks seriously at the flaws in modern science that the movement proposes to remedy, the prospect for improvement in at least four areas are unimpressive. This suggests that the agenda is effectively to re-engineer science along the lines of platform capitalism, under the misleading banner of opening up science to the masses‚Äù ([Mirowski, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mirowski-2018-aa7142a6e74e4c4989c33162f3a32e24?pvs=21) p.171).

He argues that open science ultimately dilutes and compartmentalizes the scientific pursuit, similar to line of production, to make way for a kind of technocratic data sharing which ultimately only serves the neoliberal market: ‚ÄúOpen science is to conventional science as ‚Äòonline education‚Äô is to university education: Neither has as its primary goal serious enlightenment of the citizenry. [‚Ä¶] Indeed, it would even be misguided to infer that Science 2.0 is being driven by some technological imperative to ‚Äòimprove‚Äô science in any coherent sense; rather, it seeks to maximize data revelation as a means to its eventual monetization‚Äù ([Mirowski, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mirowski-2018-aa7142a6e74e4c4989c33162f3a32e24?pvs=21), p. 193).

Hence as an ideal, open science processes science to be a perfect content for a platform economy: ‚Äúnominal ‚Äòopenness‚Äô constitutes the ideal setup for near real-time surveillance of the research process, a Panopticon of Science, something that can be turned around and sold in the very same sense that Facebook provides real-time surveillance of consumer behavior. [‚Ä¶] the company that controls the platform is the company that eventually comes to dominate the industry‚Äù [Mirowski, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mirowski-2018-aa7142a6e74e4c4989c33162f3a32e24?pvs=21) p.195f).

This, again raises questions of equity since with further commodification, already pre existing power hierarchies might be replicated. For instance, exclusion of poorly funded research groups from publication through the author-pays open-Access model or through the sharing of infrastructures for data which require resources to curate and maintain ([Ross-Hellauer et al., 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Ross-Hellauer-et-al-2022-98627959258d4cf0be406b832d8cdebd?pvs=21)).

Instead of trenching the scientific process into commodifiable pieces, Sabina Leonelli suggests a realignment of the open-science ideal and a re-orientation towards the process and the means of sharing data and other resources: ‚ÄúOS [Open Science] practices can better support the quality of scientific outputs when they focus on the specific ways in which accessibility is provided, and particularly the strategies used within specific research situations to decide who counts as a contributor, how objects should be handled and interpreted, and what goals should be pursued. [‚Ä¶] This is a process-oriented philosophy of science, which calls attention to the conditions under which outputs are produced, disseminated, stored and deployed, and conceptualizes scientific research as primarily aimed to advance active knowledge. Far from being solely a question of sharing resources, openness is thereby conceptualized as the opportunity to make and maintain connections among relevant stakeholders in the research process ‚Äì whether these be professional researchers, other publics, non-human organisms or machines ‚Äì in ways that help to develop ever more relevant forms of interaction with the world‚Äù ([Leonelli, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Leonelli-2023-a04b359cb62f4f459e2d17d03924282e?pvs=21), p. 66f)

### Summary of Recommendations from [Science as an Open Enterprise, 2012](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Science-as-an-Open-Enterprise-2012-76cb2791672742ac8bc79877c52fcc5e?pvs=21) (chat GPT)

1. **Promote Open Data:** Scientists should openly communicate and share data and models, ensuring they are accessible and usable for specialists worldwide. Universities and research institutes need to incentivize this practice by recognizing and rewarding effective data communication.
2. **Institutional Support:** Universities and research institutes should support an open data culture by recognizing data communication in career progression, developing data strategies, and adopting open data as a default position.
3. **Research Assessment:** University research assessments should value the development of open data on par with journal articles and other publications, and reward collaborative efforts.
4. **Professional Bodies' Role:** Learned societies, academies, and professional bodies should advocate for open science among members and ensure financially sustainable open access to journal articles, promoting enhanced data management.
5. **Funding Bodies' Role:** Research councils and charities should improve data communication by recognizing those who excel in data usability and communication, covering data preparation costs, and ensuring dataset sustainability.
6. **Journal Requirements:** Scientific journals should require accessible, usable, and traceable data for publication, with clear indications of data availability conditions.
7. **Industry Collaboration:** Industry sectors and regulators should collaborate on data sharing practices that serve the public interest, including sharing negative or null results.
8. **Government Policies:** Governments should recognize open data's potential to enhance scientific excellence, developing complementary policies for scientific and open government data, and supporting necessary tools and skills.
9. **Proportionate Governance:** Data sharing should follow proportionate governance, sharing personal data only when necessary for high public value research, with proper safeguards and authorizations in place.
10. **Security and Protocols:** Adopt good practice and information sharing protocols based on commercial standards, recognizing that security can be enhanced through greater openness as well as traditional measures.
