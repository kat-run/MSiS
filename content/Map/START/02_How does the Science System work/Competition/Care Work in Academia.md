**Abstract/Summary**

> _Recognizing the university as an institution in which care is embedded (though invisibly) allows us to evaluate‚Äòhow well the institution meets its caring obligations by being highly explicit about its pursuit of purposes, how it copes with particularity, and how power is used within the organization‚Äô (Tronto, 2010, p. 160) [‚Ä¶]. Acknowledging care as a value and practice may reduce gender inequalities within an organization by improving its responsiveness to the needs of different community members._

For Heidegger, care is the fundamental aspect of being. In ‚ÄúSein und Zeit‚Äù, he writes that we are care, and¬†**care is what we call the human being: ‚ÄúWeil zu Dasein wesenhaft das In-der-Welt-sein geh√∂rt, ist sein Sein zur Welt wesenhaft Besorgen (****[Heidegger, 1963](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Heidegger-1963-a3a6e000a92a4f84b906e700f38da760?pvs=21)****, p.57).** Subsequently, concepts of care and care work are well established in feminist theory, Science Technology Studies and beyond.

Key aspects of this concept are the emphasis on relationability, interdependence and interconnectedness, not just between humans but also between humans and nature and more abstract concepts such as the future where it can help to ‚Äúforeshadow for us, an activity that unites our emotional, imaginative, and rational sides‚Äù ([Adam & Groves, 2011](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Adam-Groves-2011-57c868962b8a4cbca81b0f56d25cdce6?pvs=21), p. 22). Extending and receiving care, elevating our sensitivity towards others and the world is a cornerstone of this theory ([Himmelstein et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Himmelstein-et-al-2018-0679d1cb85a24d4f8df6e1be32ce2e8a?pvs=21), [Adam & Groves, 2011](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Adam-Groves-2011-57c868962b8a4cbca81b0f56d25cdce6?pvs=21) ). In summary. ‚Äúcare is a relational, affective practice that is attentive to the marginalized, unheard, or under-valued, and that seeks the maintenance of common worlds‚Äù ([Pham et al., 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Pham-et-al-2024-0d042f1bff76455ea6a66739fe278292?pvs=21), p. 69)

There are many ways in which we give and take care, from patient-to caregiver relationships to care for the environment or care for the future. In the context of academia, I want to raise two aspects which I examine through the lens of care. Firstly, the effects of care work on academic careers and the gendered perception of said care work and secondly, I want to raise the point of the care (work) that is needed within the academic system and to which extent also this kind of work is gendered.

1. **Care work is seen as a disadvantage in academic careers**

‚ÄúThe interconnectedness of care and gender is one of the essential structural foundations of our social order and is also reflected in the scientific community.‚Äù ([Schl√∂gl et al., 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schl-gl-et-al-2019-4a8c09e61947427f98b6826c1409f632?pvs=21) p.10). In the workplace in general, but also in a highly competitive field such as academia, having to care for children or elderly relatives is seen as negatively impacting work performance. And while it is true that, on average, women spend more time with care work in the family than men, also if they have higher degrees, female academics are more often assumed to be responsible for care work at home, whereas their male colleagues are not (ibid.). Also the need for [[Mobility]] in academic careers which often interferes with care responsibilities, especially in young families [Ivancheva et al., 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Ivancheva-et-al-2019-d174ffbee7594767b5ac18e276142653?pvs=21) is disproportionately disfavoring women in academia. Because care work is often not tangible and can often not be expressed by numbers and indicators, it tends to get overlooked when talking about disadvantages of women in the labor market and in careers: ‚ÄúPrecarity is not just an economic issue, it is also a care issue. Accounting for care reveals the Janus face of labor precarity for women: it highlights the precarity of affective relations in a globalized world. The focus on women in leadership positions and promotion at workplaces eclipses the structural constraints on women who stay in permanent full‚Äêtime employment. Focusing only on labor insecurity, without regard to caring and affective insecurities, conveys the message that women who have cracked the care‚Äêfree, temporally elastic and globally mobile ideal suffer no forms of precarity. However, when in leadership positions, few female academics are able ‚Äòto have it all‚Äô‚Äù ([Ivancheva et al., 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Ivancheva-et-al-2019-d174ffbee7594767b5ac18e276142653?pvs=21)).These higher demands and prejudices, are reflected by the statistics that there are less female professors and those who are, are less likely to be married with children than their male counterparts ([Mason et al., 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mason-et-al-2013-7b3ec9cea992414eb8fe07a00bb1dac2?pvs=21), see also [[The ‚Äúleaky pipeline‚Äù]]).

  

1. **The care work within the academic system**

The gendered imbalance of care work goes further than just being a disadvantage in women‚Äôs careers. Also in the [day-to.day](http://day-to.day) dealings of the academic workplace, women take over a larger share of tasks that are associated with care and valued less for the performance-centered notion of an academic career. Care in academia is as varied as academia itself. It includes researchers maintaining lab equipment and performing routine tasks like calibration of machinery or teaching and supervising students, or administrative tasks. Studies have shown that women and minorities perform a greater share of such care-related practices. For instance faculty members who belong to a minority, serve in more diversity committees and have to participate in more outreach activities ([Wijesingha & Ramos, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wijesingha-Ramos-2017-c427f21dfcc44f50b7b0ceb0c6853ee2?pvs=21)); it has also been shown that students have higher demands for female supervisors and lecturers ([El-Alayli et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/El-Alayli-et-al-2018-e22c141d8e624d34a459b1a3515eb148?pvs=21)).

For female academics, the care is often extended to the detriment of their career and of their health: ‚ÄúThese practices clash with the prestige economy of academia, which elevates internationally renowned research above other aspects of work. This invisible care work prevents women from sufficiently attending to their self-care and speaking out about their health because of the performative culture, which creates a code of silence around vulnerability issues‚Äù([Gaudet et al., 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gaudet-et-al-2022-47282979458b46268815bfbf63112cb9?pvs=21), p. 10).
