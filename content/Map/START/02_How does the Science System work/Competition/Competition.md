**Abstract/Summary**

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the academic system has undergone fundamental changes. An effect of the [[The Marketization of Science]]is the elevated competition that is especially felt by early-career researchers and academics.

The most obvious reason for this is the growth of science as a whole (see figure below). ‚ÄúThe growth of the scientific enterprise has been much faster than that of world population or the gross national products‚Äù [Schatz, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schatz-2014-95253f822b424401b11efd55beeba9ec?pvs=21), p. 423). Also the number of people attending and finishing University has risen over the last years, while teaching and research positions within the higher education system have not risen proportionally ([Vieira et al., 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Vieira-et-al-2020-00bdb6102a134bb180b787b94127253e?pvs=21)). But there are other, more subtle mechanisms contributing to the increased competition in the academic ecosystem.

According to [Donoghue, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Donoghue-2018-aee62f0a4f844d198ecbd84204b8a275?pvs=21), two factors are crucial to the development, namely ‚Äúthe further erosion of tenure coupled with the expansion of online education, where tenure is rarely part of faculty compensation‚Äîmark the beginnings of the latest transformation of the landscape of higher education‚Äù ([Donoghue, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Donoghue-2018-aee62f0a4f844d198ecbd84204b8a275?pvs=21), p. xiv). Firstly, the employment status of University staff changed (see [[Changes in the Academic Workforce - tenure, projectification and part-time]]). There are fewer and fewer permanent positions while the lion‚Äôs share of research and teaching is carried out by temporarily employed, so-called ‚Äúcontingent‚Äù faculty members or post-docs. While this is especially true for the US, also in Europe this trend is well underway (see case study [[Kettenvertragsregel (Chain-contract-Law)]] ). Secondly, as Donoghue argues, there is a continuing disparity (at least in the US) between highly selective and well-endowed Universities, that can still afford permanent Faculty, continuing research and high-quality education, and non-selective -often online- institutions who can not and do not provide the same education and research to the detriment of both the University employees and their students. [Taylor et al., 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Taylor-et-al-2013-7f13d9a80a6e4fc0972779712885a407?pvs=21) use the term ‚ÄúQuasi-Markets‚Äù to describe these developments and state, that in an inter-disciplinary competition for increasingly limited funds and increasing tuition fees, there is a competition for money and talent between the humanities and the ‚Äúhard‚Äù sciences, i.e. the biomedical sciences. In this competition, the humanities are bound to lose due to the increased emphasis by policymakers on developing the biomedical sector and the increased economic incentives promised by a career in the life sciences.

Even though it often seems that the humanities are losing to the life sciences in the quasi-market competition, the life sciences and especially the biomedical sciences face their own competition crisis which comes with its considerable growth, both in terms of size, as well as in terms of prestige. Already in 2014, some of the most reputable scientists in the field, issued a warning about the ‚Äúunsustainable hypercompetitive system that is discouraging even the most outstanding prospective students from entering our profession‚Äîand making it difficult for seasoned investigators to produce their best work‚Äù [Alberts et al., 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Alberts-et-al-2014-d710f48eb64248569f00f7d341a5f4ba?pvs=21), p. p. 5773. They call for a more predictive and long-term funding scheme, fewer PhD and Postdoc positions with better education, stable employment and higher pay, as well as a better reputation for career paths outside of academia. [Fochler et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fochler-et-al-2016-ad0d5bd0a02b4a6dbd76470719c25638?pvs=21) describe the valuation logics of early-career researchers in Austria socialized in this hyper-competitive environment and find, that especially at the postdoc stage, researchers are very critical of this competitive system, however they can‚Äôt imagine any other alternative. The focus of early career researchers is primarily to ‚Äúsucceed in competition based on productivity in terms of acquiring internationally accepted and transferable tokens of academic quality, that is, indexed publications, grant money and recorded citations‚Äù [Fochler et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fochler-et-al-2016-ad0d5bd0a02b4a6dbd76470719c25638?pvs=21), p. 196).

This focus on competition and productivity based on publications, citations, and funding, has several implications for the scientific system as a whole. Firstly, the reduction to these few, very specialized, indicators of competitiveness prevents young researchers from acquiring other skills that can be transferrable elsewhere which in turn focuses them even more to stay in the highly competitive academic system. Secondly, the pressure leads to self-selection of those who do not want to survive in such a high-pressure environment but might otherwise be very well suited for academia. Thirdly, the competitiveness might be detrimental to the social structures of research groups, as well as to wider social life, not just of the early career scientists themselves: ‚Äúacademic socialization in the life sciences seems to structurally inhibit engaging with societal responsibility rather than fostering it‚Äù ([Fochler et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fochler-et-al-2016-ad0d5bd0a02b4a6dbd76470719c25638?pvs=21), p. 198). Lastly, also the content of research is changing with the focus on competition, rather than on knowledge production. Practices like choosing low-risk projects, the exaggeration or premature publication of results, less focus on reproducing results and many more aspects are a consequence of the elevated pressure and competitiveness of the system.
