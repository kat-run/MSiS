**Abstract/Summary (perplexity AI)**

The article "Are There Too Many Postdocs?" from Science discusses the growing concern that there are too many postdocs, especially in light of the limited number of permanent academic positions available[4]. The article argues that a postdoc should be seen as a step in career progression rather than a career in itself.

Several Nature articles explore the challenges facing postdocs, including low pay, job insecurity, and lack of career progression[1][5]. A recent Nature survey found that postdocs in their thirties tend to be more negative about their experiences compared to those in their twenties, as they tire of putting their lives on hold[5].

The mismatch between the large number of postdocs and the limited number of permanent academic positions is a significant issue. While nearly two-thirds of postdocs surveyed by Nature intend to continue their careers in academia, the path from PhD to professor is neither straightforward nor something that can be planned[1]. Some sources suggest that fewer than 5% of PhD graduates end up in permanent academic positions, while others estimate it could be as high as 30%[1].

This surplus of postdocs is causing problems for some countries, such as South Africa, where many talented researchers are leaving the country for better opportunities abroad, leading to a "brain drain"[3]. In India, talented graduate students who choose to develop their careers at home are being overlooked for faculty positions[3].

To address these issues, experts suggest that universities and research institutions need to treat postdocs better as employees, provide more support for their well-being, and hold employers accountable for their treatment[1][3]. Changing the mindset of individual principal investigators and developing staff-scientist roles to oversee technological change in the scientific enterprise could also help[3].

> proliferation of postdoctoral positions, regardless of the long‚Äêterm employment opportunities inside or outside of academia raises serious ethical questions for universities.
