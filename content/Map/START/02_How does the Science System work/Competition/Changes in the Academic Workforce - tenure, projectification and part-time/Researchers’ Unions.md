**Abstract/Summary**

Following the massive rise of non-tenured positions at Universities and especiallly since the Covid-crisis, there has been a rise in the US and beyond, for non-tenure track personell to unionize and demand better pay and working conditions. To many, this devlopment does not come as a surprise: ‚ÄúUnionization is a hopeful option in those states that have not discouraged or suppressed unions. I doubt that administrators could have foreseen that, by staffing classes with adjuncts, they were unwittingly fomenting a culture of brilliant labor activists with advanced degrees, but that‚Äôs what they did. [Donoghue, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Donoghue-2018-aee62f0a4f844d198ecbd84204b8a275?pvs=21), p. xxv.

Examples for this ongoing trend are the unionization of lecturers at [[Researchers‚Äô Unions]]24, Postdoc Unions in several elite-universities such as [[Researchers‚Äô Unions]]. ‚ÄúAdjuncts, along with graduate students, are currently organizing more aggressively than any other sector of the teaching workforce. Yet the aims of adjunct activism are deeply ambivalent‚Äù [Donoghue, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Donoghue-2018-aee62f0a4f844d198ecbd84204b8a275?pvs=21), p. 59.

In [Europe](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1356735/labor-unions-most-unionized-countries-worldwide/), unionization has historically been more common and rooted in civil society with major Unions also representing teaching and University personell. Historically, scandinavian countries have the [highest unionization rates](https://www.progressivepolicy.org/blogs/ppis-trade-fact-of-the-week-scandinavia-has-the-worlds-highest-union-membership-rates/). In the UK about 40% of the University personell is unionized in the [UCU](https://ucu.org.uk/article/1685/About-UCU) (University and College Union)
