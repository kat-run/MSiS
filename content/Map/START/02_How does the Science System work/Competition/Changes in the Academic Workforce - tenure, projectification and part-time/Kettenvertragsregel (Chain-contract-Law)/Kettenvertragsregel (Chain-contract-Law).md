**Abstract/Summary**

§109 of the University law in Austria states that, unlike other employers, Universities can add several short term contracts after another. This led to the majority of research personnel being employed on a short-term basis. With a change in the law in 2021, the duration of these consecutive short term contracts was shortened from indefinitely to 8 years. After this time, Universities either have to change the contract into a permanent one or let the employee go.

Originally intended as a measure to provide more job-security to University employees, the measure backfired. Since many of these positions are relying on third party funding, the University can often not guarantee the funds for a fixed employment. Additionally, in budget negotiations between faculties and the university, and ultimately the ministry, fixed positions are often hard to argue for. Facing this, the employers often rather employ a new scientist with a new short term contract.

> _Die Gretchenfrage ist, wie die Unis mit dieser Zeitvorgabe umgehen. Werden sie Wissenschafter, die sich über acht Jahre bewährt haben, wirklich fix anstellen, um deren Fähigkeiten zu halten? Oder werden die Betroffenen doch gehen müssen, weil sich die Unis lieber als Ersatz jemanden Neuen holen, den man wiederum befristet engagieren kann?_

> The key question is how the universities will deal with this time limit. Will they really employ academics who have proven themselves over eight years on a permanent basis in order to retain their skills? Or will the people concerned have to leave after all, because the universities would rather bring in someone new as a replacement, who can then be hired on a temporary basis? [Anders, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Anders-2023-41c1119eaab4437081f71a38ff4f7fad?pvs=21)

Universities are aware of this problem and try to augment the fixed positions. However, due to the historical dimensions, with two thirds of the workforce in limited contracts it is hard to scale this process to the needs of all employees and employers. For instance, in 2023 the University of Vienna, Austria’s largest University, announced the creation of 40 Senior Scientist positions for employees, who would otherwise have to be let go. Considering the hundreds of scientists employed with a limited contract, this is not even close to being enough.

This mode of employment is often hurting young families and people who want to have children as the big insecurity of not getting a permanent position coincides with the age where many academics start a young family. Especially women who are otherwise materially not secured, often decide against having children in this climate ([Koi, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Koi-2023-3ce1bbc293c0408b9abd79681bf94925?pvs=21)). Also teaching is negatively affected by the rule as most of the adjunct lecturers are mostly employed on a half-year basis which is added on top of their regular employment, meaning an even higher turnover and less continuity for students ([APA, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/APA-2023-938b0e45d95a4a0da4227f43d2e1ac78?pvs=21)).
