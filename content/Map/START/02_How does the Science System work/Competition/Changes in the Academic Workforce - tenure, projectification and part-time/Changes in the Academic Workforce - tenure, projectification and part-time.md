**Abstract/Summary**

Together with the rise [[Market Logics in Universities]] and the rising number of students due to better [[Access to higher education]], the structure of the academic workforce has undergone drastic changes. As with many trends in this area, the developments have an earlier onset and a more drastic outcome in the US (see statistics below), but are largely also present in Europe. In Austria, for instance, 80 of the scientific personnel (i.e. researchers), about 60% of the administrative and technical personnel and a staggering 96% of lecturers are employed on a short term basis ([Koi, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Koi-2023-3ce1bbc293c0408b9abd79681bf94925?pvs=21)). However, due to better workers‚Äô protections in Europe, as compared to the US, for instance when it comes to health care, pensions, and maternity protections, the contingent workers in Europe are better protected.

The most drastic change in the academic workforce is probably the rise of the so-called ‚Äúcontingent‚Äù faculty position and the fall of permanent- and tenure-track positions (see image below). ‚ÄúContingent faculty now constitute a significant majority of the postsecondary teaching workforce and will eventually replace traditional professors at all but a handful of very expensive private institutions‚Äù ([Donoghue, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Donoghue-2018-aee62f0a4f844d198ecbd84204b8a275?pvs=21) p. xviii). Here, the distinction between well-endowed , selective private institutions and non-selective online institutions is crucial. If this trend continues, donoghue argues, there will be an ever greater divide between the two types of institutions, both in terms of how they treat their personnel, but also in the quality of teaching: Students at, respectively, highly selective and nonselective universities will receive very different educations. These different educations identically mirror and permanently reinforce the income inequality that already pervades the country. Scholarly research will survive only at the highly selective institutions, and only students who attend those institutions will be exposed to research as a rewarding intellectual activity.‚Äù ([Donoghue, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Donoghue-2018-aee62f0a4f844d198ecbd84204b8a275?pvs=21), p. xxv). Not just teaching, but also research gets carried out primarily by short-term employed personnel, namely PhD students and postdocs ([Herschberg et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Herschberg-et-al-2018-775342f8066041bca57c538cf079de5a?pvs=21)). Apart from being cheaper for the employer (the University), this type of employment is better suited to react to the changes in [[Funding]], which are increasingly short term and projectified. Also the requirement for [[Mobility]] for building a career in science is met with short-term contracts. It would be interesting to look into this connection and the causality between mobility and short-term employment, but this has not been investigated in-depth.

The consequences of the rise in contingent workforce at institutions of higher education, are evident in the faculty itself, in research and teaching. Especially in non-selective and for-profit universities in the US, most of the teaching is outsourced to external lecturers who are often employed by more than one institution. This has particular consequences on the quality of teaching: ‚ÄúThe profile that emerges is deeply conflicted. On the one hand, contingent faculty acknowledge that their working conditions, particularly the practice of ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù staff management, hinder their ability to be effective in the classroom. On the other hand, they feel the need to conceal their professional obstacles and hardships from their students.‚Äù [Donoghue, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Donoghue-2018-aee62f0a4f844d198ecbd84204b8a275?pvs=21) p. xviii. Hence, the students who are taught in this way, are unaware of the pressures of the system when they enter it. [Felt & Fochler, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-Fochler-2013-63ea1d5bbc1043be9fd0f94c7f750169?pvs=21) describe a similar mechanism in which the narratives circulating science serve as tacit governance elements to socialize young researchers in a hyper-competitive system where things like precarious working conditions are accepted as the norm. With short-term funding, mobility and contingent working conditions comes an increasing projectification ([Felt, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2017-cbcdcb1df1244a3d83f4531b2091d9c3?pvs=21)) of research and the inability of early-career researchers to conceive of- and to carry out- long-term projects which are often incommensurable with the temporal and spatial regimes that come with a career in academia.

Lastly, the new norm of contingent employment has effects on the Faculty itself, weakening what [Donoghue, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Donoghue-2018-aee62f0a4f844d198ecbd84204b8a275?pvs=21) (p. 67) calls ‚Äúthe social strength that professions gain by acting as a close-knit cohort‚Äù. The consequence of this is that faculty overall, also tenured professors, have less agency: ‚Äúa weak faculty translates into one governed by fear rather than by shared responsibilities, one that is susceptible to labor-bashing tactics such as increased workloads, the casualization of labor, and the growing suppression of dissent. Demoralization often translates less into moral outrage than into cynicism, accommodation, and a retreat into a sterile form of professionalism.‚Äù ([Giroux, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Giroux-2014-20c30865408446ddb6d170071f45f881?pvs=21), p. 26). For a University, which is supposed to be a place of pursuit and passing on of knowledge, this development is potentially detrimental. Additionally, as described above, the problems are largely unknown to the students which in turn are the next generation of researchers and teachers: ‚ÄúMany academics have disappeared into a disciplinary apparatus that views the university not as a place to think but as a place to prepare students to be competitive in the global marketplace‚Äù ([Giroux, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Giroux-2014-20c30865408446ddb6d170071f45f881?pvs=21) p. 27).

Furthermore, these developments may change the role of academics in society as a whole: ‚ÄùAs faculties no longer feel compelled to address important political issues and social problems, they are less inclined to communicate with a larger public, uphold public values, or engage in a type of scholarship accessible to a broader audience‚Äù ([Giroux, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Giroux-2014-20c30865408446ddb6d170071f45f881?pvs=21), p.26).
