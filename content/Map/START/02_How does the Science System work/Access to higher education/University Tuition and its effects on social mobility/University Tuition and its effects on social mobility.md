**Abstract/Summary (Perplexity AI)**

There are several studies that examine how university tuition and costs affect social mobility:

A 2024 study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that poorer students are more likely to be discouraged from living away from home for university due to the high costs, deterring them from applying. It noted a decline in higher education participation, especially among disadvantaged students, due to skyrocketing costs of being a student[1].

A 2019 joint statement by the Russell Group and social mobility charities argued that cutting university tuition fees could be dangerous for social mobility. They explained that lower fees primarily benefit higher-earning graduates who end up contributing less to their education costs. Reduced funding would also likely lead to fewer student places, hurting disadvantaged students most[2].

A 2023 report by Unity Environmental University ranked it \#1 in Maine for social mobility. The article discusses barriers to social mobility in education like high tuition, living expenses, and student loan interest rates. It notes that students from the top 1% income bracket are 34% more likely to attend top colleges than others[3].

A 2012 Pew study found that children born in the lowest income quintile who do not earn a bachelor's degree are four times more likely to remain in the bottom income bracket as those who do earn a degree. However, only 14.5% of students in the lowest socioeconomic quartile earned a bachelor's degree over a 10 year period, compared to 61% in the top income quartile[4] (see below).

A 2020 study presented at the Momentum Congress found that tuition fees have a hampering effect on social mobility in Austria, on top of other barriers. It argued that being able to afford living away from home for university is crucial for social advancement after graduation, and high costs deter many disadvantaged students from applying[6].

In summary, multiple studies demonstrate that high tuition costs and student expenses are significant barriers to higher education access and completion for low-income students, limiting social mobility. Reducing tuition fees may not be an effective solution, as it could lead to fewer student places and less funding for support programs. Providing adequate need-based financial aid and addressing disparities in K-12 education quality appear to be important factors in improving social mobility through higher education.

A higher education degree is still a good way to escape poverty, however, the main problem is that low-income students often don‚Äôt finish their education, not that they are not accepted: ‚Äú**the college payoff only accrues to those who finish a degree, and very few low-income people make it that far**‚Äú ([Kelly, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Kelly-2014-363684db2e0047449425e1d82102a1a5?pvs=21)). The one of the main reasons for this according to the author is that the school education before entering university is not preparing the low income students adequately. Another one lies in the colleges themselves. Tuition fees (in the case of low income students provided by financial aid) are payed regardless if students finish their degree or not. The colleges themselves have no incentive of making sure, that also margialized groups, who are less prepared for college by culture and education, earn degrees.
