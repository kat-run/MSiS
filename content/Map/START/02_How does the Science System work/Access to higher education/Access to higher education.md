UN SDG Goal nr. 4

Until the 20th century, higher education was only available for a very select few, often from a wealthy background. This changed after the second world war, where Universities for the first time became more open to different segments of society. For instance in the US, with the Servicemen‘s Readjustment Act of 1944 (G.I. Bill), the government broadly funded veterans’ access to college education “This infusion of government funding created a situation wherein the veterans approximately doubled the number of students enrolled in higher education within a few years” [Morris et al., 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Morris-et-al-2023-dabae5f89ac9487a928b911ad93b985a?pvs=21). In Europe, even though not through common legislation, universities also opened up to larger segments of the public in the postwar period. In Germany for instance, new Universities were founded and the University system was conceived towards a “Humboildtian model” of higher education where teaching and research are closely tied and a multidisciplinary approach to research and education is held as the ideal ([Bongaerts, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bongaerts-2022-e5961f21e12f4769a8f2e6c325397684?pvs=21)); broad access was an integral part of this reform and codified into law with the 1976 “Hochschulrahmengesetz” ([Pritchard, 1986](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Pritchard-1986-be4fbe837d96456fbf55fba08ec456e9?pvs=21)). Since then, student numbers have risen globally, but Universities, funds for higher education, as well as teaching personnel has not risen to the same extend: “Still, the growth has been insufficient to match the rising demand driven by improved access to primary and secondary education, a growing young population, and employment shifting away from agriculture to manufacturing and services.” [Vieira et al., 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Vieira-et-al-2020-00bdb6102a134bb180b787b94127253e?pvs=21), p.27).

In our current knowledge society, access to higher education is vital for the development of both individuals and nation states. This is reflected by the United Nations sustainable development goal number four (”**Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”)**. The UNESCO International Institute for Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean (UNESCO IESALC) investigated the developments of global access to higher education in the last 20 years in a recent report ([Vieira et al., 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Vieira-et-al-2020-00bdb6102a134bb180b787b94127253e?pvs=21)). Over this timespan enrollment to higher education worldwide almost doubled, going from 19% to 38% between 2000 and 2018. with the female percentage growing at a faster rate than the male and the biggest profiter class wise being the middle-and upper middle class with the poorest of most countries still being more excluded from higher education. Other limiting factors besides poverty are crisis and emergency situations, high tuition fees, entrance examinations, geographical mobility, and discrimination which often coincide particularly in marginalized communities ([Vieira et al., 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Vieira-et-al-2020-00bdb6102a134bb180b787b94127253e?pvs=21), p. 8). Also the gap between enrollment and graduation is mainly an issue for marginalized and economically less stable environments ([Vieira et al., 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Vieira-et-al-2020-00bdb6102a134bb180b787b94127253e?pvs=21), p. 9). While the elevated access gained over the last two decades is considerable, the demand for a more and more educated workforce is still not met, highlighting the global economic shift (not just in the developed world) to a knowledge society. Hence, education today is not just a matter of personal development and social mobility, but an economic and societal prerequisite for growth and development. Studies show that a rising percentage in tertiary education benefits GDP growth all over the world, especially in developing countries ([Li et al., 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Li-et-al-2024-27c678c78e2b49eb85dfd1905e20a4d8?pvs=21)).

“Still, the growth has been insufficient to match the rising demand driven by improved access to primary and secondary education, a growing young population, and employment shifting away from agriculture to manufacturing and services.”

> Numbers From Vieira et al., 2020 Summary:“Still, the growth has been insufficient to match the rising demand driven by improved access to primary and secondary education, a growing young population, and employment shifting away from agriculture to manufacturing and services.”“Men’s enrollment increased from 19% to 36%, while women’s enrollment went from 19% to 41% from 2000 to 2018, becoming the main beneficiaries of increased access to tertiary education worldwide. ““There are still significant differences in access, particularly for income groups. The poorest population continues to lag behind, with 10% access to higher education in 2018 compared to 77% of the higher income sector in the same year.”“HEI [Higher Education Institutions] are diversifying alongside their student bodies. Private institutions in particular have grown in number, size, specialization, and mission.”“Similar to private institutions, open distance education institutions have grown as well, as a result also of new technologies and internet dissemination. Instead of research programs or other types of specialized study, many new institutions provide broad access programs that have less stringent entrance criteria (7).”
