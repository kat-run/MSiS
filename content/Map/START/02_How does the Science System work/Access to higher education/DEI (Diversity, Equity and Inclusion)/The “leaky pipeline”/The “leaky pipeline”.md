**Abstract/Summary**

![[/Untitled 14.png|Untitled 14.png]]

As the image above demonstrates, the ‚Äúleaky pipeline‚Äù is a metaphor for the progressing imbalance between men and women in academic careers. The reasons for this are multiple. In a report [Schl√∂gl et al., 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schl-gl-et-al-2019-4a8c09e61947427f98b6826c1409f632?pvs=21), attachment to the page), which is intended to be utilized by hiring panels, the University of Vienna tries to highlight some of the most prevalent reasons and offer advice on how to make the academic pipeline less leaky. According to the report, the main reasons are the following:

1. **The Gender Bias in professional culture and the connotation of ‚ÄúGenius‚Äù as a predominantly male characteristic**

1. **Networks and Gatekeepers:** predominantly male fields have predominantly male networks which often disfavors the entry of more female colleagues.
2. **Mentoring and Recommendation:** Similar to networking, especially in the Postdoc stage the right mentors and recommendations for higher positions are crucial for a scientific career. Studies have shown that there is a gender bias in the way letters of recommendation are written where there is an emphasis in excellence and brilliance in the male candidates and an emphasis for instance on diligence for the female ones.
3. **Publishing:** On average, women publish less and with a lower impact factor. There are several reasons for this, mainly connected to point 6. However, studies which randomly added male or female author names to publications, have shown that if the author is read as male, the paper is seen as more significant, especially in male-dominated fields.
4. **Hiring:** Studies show that women‚Äôs achievement and competences get rated lower in academic hiring processes and female candidates get offered a lower salary.
5. **Work-Life Balance and Care-Work**: On average, women do more care work than men, also if they have higher degrees. ‚ÄúThe interconnectedness of care and gender is one of the essential structural foundations of our social order and is also reflected in the scientific community.‚Äù ([Schl√∂gl et al., 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schl-gl-et-al-2019-4a8c09e61947427f98b6826c1409f632?pvs=21) p.10). The culture of academia often values a 24/7 availability which is often not assumed of women who have families or other care-obligations to fulfill, whereas men are not assumed to take on the same responsibilities, for instance in childcare.
6. **Mobility:** Scientific careers require high international mobility. This requirement often disfavors women because, especially in the late Postdoc stage, which is crucial for career development, women are often in the stage of their lives where they want to start their own family which impedes mobility and hence career development.

The listed points are not the only reasons for the leaky pipeline and in the end, every career is different. However, if these - conscious or unconscious - biases are more present in the discourse, many decisions to drop out of academia could be prevented.
