1. **Supreme Court Decision**:
    - The US Supreme Court banned the use of affirmative action in college admissions, ruling it violates the equal-protection clause of the US Constitution.
2. **Purpose of Affirmative Action**:
    - Affirmative action aimed to remedy historical discrimination and foster diverse student bodies by considering students' racial backgrounds alongside other factors like test scores and extracurricular activities.
3. **Challenges in Diversity**:
    - Despite race-conscious admissions, many selective colleges struggle to reflect societal diversity. For example, the University of North Carolina has a significantly lower percentage of Black students compared to the state's population.
4. **Opposition to Affirmative Action**:
    - Opponents, such as Students for Fair Admissions (SFA), argue that considering race in admissions is discriminatory, particularly against Asian Americans. SFA has filed lawsuits against Harvard and UNC, seeking race-neutral admissions policies.
5. **History and Evolution**:
    - Affirmative action originated in the 1960s under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson to ensure equal employment opportunities and prevent discrimination. In 1978, the Supreme Court allowed race as a factor in admissions, rejecting racial quotas but acknowledging the importance of diversity.
6. **Impact of Affirmative Action**:
    - Affirmative action significantly increased the diversity of college campuses from the 1960s to early 2000s, with notable rises in Black and Latino student enrollments. However, state-level bans on affirmative action, like in California, have led to declines in diversity at selective institutions.
7. **Future Implications**:
    
    - The removal of affirmative action could result in less diverse college campuses. Past examples from states like California and Michigan show significant drops in minority student admissions following affirmative action bans, despite efforts to maintain diversity through other means.

1. **Debate on Skin Color-Based Treatment**:
    - The question arises whether citizens should be treated differently based on skin color. While most people oppose this idea, some support it for achieving enlightened ends.
2. **History of Affirmative Action**:
    - Affirmative action began as a means to provide positive discrimination for African-Americans and later other under-represented minorities in university admissions, addressing historical oppression.
3. **Supreme Court's Decision**:
    - On June 29th, the Supreme Court ended affirmative action in college admissions, citing its contorted constitutional logic, unpopularity outside progressive circles, and ineffectiveness.
4. **Criticism of Affirmative Action**:
    - Despite race-based affirmative action, top universities have not become representative. These institutions also favor the children of alumni and donors, creating an unjustifiable affirmative action for the wealthy.
5. **Legal Justification and Public Opinion**:
    - Affirmative action was justified in 1978 for promoting diversity rather than reparations. However, polls show many Americans, including Asian-Americans, oppose race-based admissions.
6. **Potential Impact of the Ruling**:
    - The ruling may lead to lawsuits against racial preferences in other areas. Universities need to ensure the decision leads to beneficial outcomes.
7. **Need for Fairer Admissions**:
    - The article suggests universities should shift from using race as a proxy for disadvantage to directly assisting individuals who are poor, regardless of race.
8. **Universities' Response and Future Admissions**:
    - Universities may find covert ways to maintain racial preferences, such as dropping standardized test requirements. Harvard indicated it might consider race in essays, hinting at compliance with the ruling in creative ways.
9. **Call for Genuine Representation**:
    
    - **The article advocates for universities to create fairer admission systems, reducing the influence of wealthy legacies and achieving genuine representation, rather than maintaining a monied monoculture.**

    Abstract:
    
    We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NLSF) to analyze the effects of affirmative action on college outcomes for among the 1999 cohort of freshmen in 28 selective colleges and universities. We develop indices of affirmative action at the individual and institutional levels to test the validity of two charges leveled by critics of affirmative action: that it undermines minority performance by placing academically unprepared students into competitive schools without the required skills and abilities (the mismatch hypothesis) and that it stigmatizes all minorities as academically challenged and intellectually weak to produce added psychological pressure that undermines academic performance (the stereotype threat hypothesis). **We find no evidence for the mismatch hypothesis. If anything, individual students with SAT scores below the institutional average do better than other students, other things equal. We do, however, find evidence consistent with the hypothesis of stereotype threat, although the effect is not particularly strong compared with other determinants of academic success.**
