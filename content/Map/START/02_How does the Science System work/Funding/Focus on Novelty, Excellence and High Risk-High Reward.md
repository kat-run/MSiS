**Abstract/Summary**

In the current climate of marketized knowledge production, competition and projectification, the focus of funding agencies lies heavily on a certain type of knowledge and knowledge production.

Major funding agencies like the [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/2021-qualitative-evaluation-projects.pdf), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-supports-106-grants-featuring-high-risk-high-reward-research), and the [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://bulletinofcas.researchcommons.org/journal/vol37/iss5/11/) all share the same language when describing their funding strategies. The Focus is on novelty, Excellence and high risk-high reward research. Here are some examples of this language:

> ‚ÄúHigh Risk-High Reward (HRHR) research refers to scientific research with high risk of failure but characterized by breakthrough, innovation and originality. It truly reflects the original innovation ability of science and technology, is committed to bringing major scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs, and is conducive to accelerating the improvement of national competitiveness in original science and technology‚Äù [CAO & ZHANG, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/CAO-ZHANG-2022-a70438e56171466a9fb8ffb45a467751?pvs=21)

> ‚ÄúThe European Research Council (ERC) supports excellent investigators and their research teams to pursue ground-breaking and high-gain/high-risk research [European Research Council (ERC), 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/European-Research-Council-ERC-2020-888e1c05f8c7487383fe2f49e43d7ad9?pvs=21)

This approach has also been lauded and lobbied for by organizations such as the Brookings Institute, the Good Science Project and the institute for progress, although in a joint report, the NIH is criticized for not following it and instead being too risk-averse ([Stephan & Young, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Stephan-Young-2023-977836b7d9eb4016ba796df319f3fb34?pvs=21)).

Conversely, the focus of research funding has shifted from giving smaller grants to many researchers to awarding large grants for projects with the aforementioned properties. The basic idea is that excellence, novelty and high risk research requires more money but subsequently has more output or social impact and fosters more collaboration. However, there are also risks of concentrating too much on these large-scale projects as they might not yield as high an impact as it seems. For instance, the Impact to monetary input ratio is smaller in large-scale projects ([Bloch & S√∏rensen, 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bloch-S-rensen-2015-bac699e33c5b4e10bf9b5eb67e57c40c?pvs=21)).

A focus on excellence and large scale projects might also deprive a broader basis of researchers from obtaining funding and create ‚Äúa class of ‚Äòresearch elites‚Äô and lead to what [Merton, 1968](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Merton-1968-dba8a614f76d453bae43d96d98b5b941?pvs=21) calls the Matthew effect namely that already prominent scientists and research groups get disproportionate attention and credit in collaboration and are therefore able to obtain more funding for less innovative ideas. Ultimately this development hampers the diversity of research overall ([Hamann, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Hamann-2018-b126715256384b61a5bf15713f9b5d12?pvs=21)).

In this context, also the notions of excellence, novelty and high-risk themselves need to be questioned. Since they are neither well-definable nor quantifiable. How excellence is assessed in practice is on the one hand through established [[Metrics and Indicators]], and on the other hand through panels of peers, who tend to stratify existing hierarchies and assessments of things such as ‚Äúnovelty‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äùby ‚Äúproducing rankings that reward those at the center of the field with an ‚Äúelite‚Äù label. The assessments also (re-) produce research elites themselves because the distribution of basic research funding that is based on them follows previous allocations of resources‚Äù ([Hamann, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Hamann-2018-b126715256384b61a5bf15713f9b5d12?pvs=21), p. 194). Hence, behind notions of excellence, there are not just ideas, but also social factors. In other words: ‚Äúthe construction of excellence turns out to be deeply grounded in the social practices of the academic world‚Äù ([Angerm√ºller, 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Angerm-ller-2010-9667e3c4bc1e4ff2b52e762a4ee88a5f?pvs=21), p. 16).

Overall, while in a climate of limited funds, it makes sense to prioritize novelty, excellence, and high-risk projects, also the unintended consequences such as the reliance on metrics and the negative effect on diversity of research need to be accounted for by funding agencies.
