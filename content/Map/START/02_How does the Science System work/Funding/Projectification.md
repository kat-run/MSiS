**Abstract/Summary**

Amongst the main changes resulting from the [[The Marketization of Science]] and changes in funding structures, is a widespread “projectification” of research. As already mentioned in [[Funding]], a large proportion of funding nowadays comes from private sources (see for instance [Svensson-Jajko, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Svensson-Jajko-2022-ba002144ff5d45598ba576f473c7ad10?pvs=21)) and public funds are given out through Funding Agencies ([MacLean et al., 1998](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/MacLean-et-al-1998-917e2c47869c4383b8f82a6ae9d6e648?pvs=21)). These diversification of funds, but also the diversifications of questions and needs from society, require a different structuring of the knowledge production process. Projectification seems to be well-suited to tackle contemporary issues: “the project format offers a temporal, fixed-term, fast and flexible way to achieve specific one-off goals. It is a targeted tool for a targeted function, which matches well with the suddenly emerging and rapidly changing needs of organizations” ([Ylijoki, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Ylijoki-2016-a450e564704342db83f9bdec2aa3198d?pvs=21), p. 9).

Projectification is not unique to the science system and has been a hallmark of changing temporal regimes, both in the entrepreneurial world, as well as in the public sector and in society in general ([Jensen et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Jensen-et-al-2016-4559747211154c97a711df2004a8ff54?pvs=21) [Hodgson & Fred, 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Hodgson-Fred-2019-ee36872264f24842854bbe199cad8caa?pvs=21), [Büttner, 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/B-ttner-2019-2d4bd91864c24aaaa8d9439731695091?pvs=21)). However, the projectification of scientific knowledge production has had several different impacts for the system itself and for the people working in it: “the project format is not a mere technical organizational tool, but […] it challenges and reshapes research practices and ideals” [Ylijoki, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Ylijoki-2016-a450e564704342db83f9bdec2aa3198d?pvs=21). In the next few paragraphs, I will outline some of these implications.

Indeed, the projectification of research seems to accelerate the innovation process and make interdisciplinary research more manageable ([Baur et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Baur-et-al-2018-e1b796d2b4a84d60bfb557135dacfef7?pvs=21)). By focusing on a project, rather than on a discipline or a subject, it is easier to coordinate people from different disciplines, to define and oversee the outcomes, in short to _manage_ the research process. It is also easier for the governing bodies of research agencies to clearly define objectives and hand out grants accordingly. Especially in industrial settings, projectified research has led to a more target-oriented way of doing science, as opposed to classic academia, and therefore accelerating the innovation process: “organized groups of researchers would not produce knowledge on the basis of creative, unique, and therefore less controllable ideas but that certain ways of organizing research would ensure the generation of a controllable stream of knowledge and technical discoveries” ([Baur et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Baur-et-al-2018-e1b796d2b4a84d60bfb557135dacfef7?pvs=21), p. 350). In a system, where there are not enough funds to finance all research endeavors (as is the current _status-quo_ in most circumstances), project- and merit-based funding ideally leads to a more competitive system, with the best projects gaining the most financial resources.

Paradoxically, this competition in and of itself also leads to inefficiencies in the process: ”Writing research applications takes a lot of time and energy, but it is experienced as wasted time, since most applications will be unsuccessful because of the heavy competition. This creates a paradox: the project format, which was intended to produce maximal efficiency, creates waste-time and inefficiency” ([Ylijoki, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Ylijoki-2016-a450e564704342db83f9bdec2aa3198d?pvs=21), p. 21). Additionally, administrative tasks in the course of a project can hinder researchers’ availability for carrying out research and are perceived as less meaningful.

As projectification accelerates the competitiveness, as well as the pace of research, discovery, publication and funding, research careers are getting more and more “projectified”. This is especially felt by researchers in the postdoctoral stage of their career ([Müller, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/M-ller-2014-013f8bdab8b84b06a41648138233afe1?pvs=21)), who often get employed from one short-term contract to the next (→ [[Changes in the Academic Workforce - tenure, projectification and part-time]]). The socialization in this system, in turn, has tacit governance effects on how junior researchers plan their careers and select their research interests. However, it would be inadequate to picture (young) academics as mere victims without any agency. Instead, they often find ways how to navigate and use projectification for their own interests. Hence, project-based research and funding can at the same time be a source of frustration and anxiety, and also provide autonomy and opportunities for young researchers to break away from constraints of their institution and give them more resources to carry out their research ([Ylijoki, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Ylijoki-2016-a450e564704342db83f9bdec2aa3198d?pvs=21),[Baur et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Baur-et-al-2018-e1b796d2b4a84d60bfb557135dacfef7?pvs=21)).

Last but not least, the projectification regimes have an impact on the knowledge production and dissemination itself. Short-term grants require projects that can efficiently be tackled in the given timeframe, making certain types of research, like longterm and explorative projects, more difficult to argue for and to carry out. People who are socialized in this system might only be able to conceptualize and carry out research in these short timeframes, both because they are required to do so by the system and because they have been taught to do it that way. The issue is, that not all worthwhile research topics can be easily fitted into thees narrow temporal frameworks or in the accompanying funding regimes ([O’Malley et al., 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/O-Malley-et-al-2009-268df3e16e2a459ca761bfbca3f0a809?pvs=21)). Together with the growing power of [[Metrics and Indicators]] , this “chronopolitics” [(](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?B0A5e3)[Felt, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2017-cbcdcb1df1244a3d83f4531b2091d9c3?pvs=21)) of projectification provides a rigid temporal- and material regime according to which knowledge production is shaped. For instance in the social sciences, there is a shift from publishing longer works to towards research papers, who better fit into the temporal regimes of projectification: “Knowledge production must now be packaged in (generally) three-year units, and publications are required during this time-span to demonstrate the worth of the investment” ([Felt, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2017-cbcdcb1df1244a3d83f4531b2091d9c3?pvs=21), p. 55).

There is also resistance against the “projectification” of the research process on several levels. As already mentioned above, researchers can use projects to their advantage, often by complying with the project structure only on a superficial level:

There is also resistance against the “projectification” of the research process on several levels. As already mentioned above, researchers can use projects to their advantage, often by complying with the project structure only on a superficial level: “at the front-stage, formal PM [Project Management] technology and terminology is used by specially appointed research managers as means of presenting to funding agencies and other external parties. At the backstage, researchers carry out work in more traditional forms” ([Fowler et al., 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fowler-et-al-2015-3324dd7f1f3541358c440ba365b999dd?pvs=21), p. 9) There is also a more institutionalized resistance. [Torka, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Torka-2018-2324cf090c7246a4b231af615660e1b9?pvs=21) describes how disciplines like Theoretical and Experimental Physics resist projectification of PhD projects “due to specific epistemic, social and career-stage-specific preconditions” [Torka, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Torka-2018-2324cf090c7246a4b231af615660e1b9?pvs=21), p. 80). For instance by not recruiting doctoral candidates for predefined projects but rather recruiting them based on talent or specialization and subsequently developing research within larger epistemic collectives.

**In summary it can be said that the projectification of knowledge production is a double edged sword. For some research processes it accelerates innovation and makes interdisciplinary work easier. It is also easier to oversee the investment, which in most cases comes from taxpayers. Hence, it is no surprise that project-based funding has become the norm for investing money in knowledge production, increasing the competition amongst researchers for funding. This competition has a shaping effect on scientific careers, as well as on the way knowledge is produced; which is often seen as a negative development by the epistemic community (see quote below). It would be important for public funding agencies to heed these concerns and develop schemes, especially for young researchers to break away from the strong constraints of projectification.**
