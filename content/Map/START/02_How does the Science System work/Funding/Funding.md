**Summary**

The scientific pursuit takes a huge amount of money. Instruments have to be bought and run, reagents and chemicals have to be procured, students have to be taught, books have to be bought, salaries have to be payed. Institutions who are funded can be either public like Universities or public research institutes, or private like R&D departments of companies. Also the source of funding can be public or private. All of this, the priorities, the timeframe, the conditionalities, and accountabilities of funding regimes have profound effects on the temporal framework of research, on the type of knowledge production, and on the people who work within the system.

How much value is attributed to higher education, research and development - and much money is actually allocated to it - depends greatly on the national context and tradition (an analytical framework is provided by [Dobbins et al., 2011](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Dobbins-et-al-2011-4a619b9eeed74cba9898557d50b4d97b?pvs=21), see also figures below). However, as a general principle, any type of investment, both public and private, in higher education and R&D benefit the economic development of any country ([Coccia, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Coccia-2008-6b06c0e776cd41b292989dac3c6beebe?pvs=21)).

Despite the many different national strategies and emphases, there are some developments and trends that are common to the (global north-) way of funding science which have shaped knowledge production in the last years. The logics of [[The Marketization of Science]]have also shaped the way science is funded: ‚ÄúAt both national and regional scales, higher education has become firmly incorporated into a neo-liberal discourse of ‚Äòglobal competitiveness‚Äô‚Äù ([Robertson & Keeling, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Robertson-Keeling-2008-07aeef7a332e4147bcc115c60179e2a7?pvs=21), p.221).

Most evidently, a market-orientation of the epistemic system has had impacts on the source of funding. Whereas in the post-war period, universities were mostly funded directly by the state and allocated the money autonomously within the institution. Employees were mostly tenured hence stayed at one institution for long periods of time. In the US, starting in the 1980s, along with the wave of privatization and the era of trickle-down-economics, the sources of funding shifted steadily from public to private sources and public-private partnerships were encouraged by policy makers. An example for this is the Bayh-Doyle act from 1980 which allows patenting of discoveries by Universities, making collaborations with the private sector easier and shifting the focus from discovery to the marketability of research ([Mirowski, 2011](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mirowski-2011-52e3e8247a3a495e8aaa1c878effe839?pvs=21)). In Europe this shift in funding happens at a later stage but its dynamics are similar. In liaison with the ‚ÄúBologna process‚Äù which aimed at standardizing the European higher education system, and the emergence of the European single market, also a ‚Äúneo-liberal language of economic competitiveness in higher education policies at the European level‚Äù ([Robertson & Keeling, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Robertson-Keeling-2008-07aeef7a332e4147bcc115c60179e2a7?pvs=21), p. 222) took root and European institutions shifted the funding structure from a state-centered model towards a more market-oriented model in similar a line than the US with a new focus on mixed funding, [[Projectification]] and strengthening relations with industry. For instance, in Austria in 2021 more than 50% of research funding was derived from private sources ([Svensson-Jajko, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Svensson-Jajko-2022-ba002144ff5d45598ba576f473c7ad10?pvs=21)).

Together with the influx of funds from private entities, also a large proportion of public funding is no longer given to institutions directly according to input-based criteria, such as number of students or personnel, but according to outcome-based criteria, like number of highly ranked publications ([Fr√∏lich et al., 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fr-lich-et-al-2010-79ba80538d054df98cd9b32ce359187e?pvs=21)). In order to implement this merit-based system, allocate funds more efficiently and establish closer connection to market and policymaking ([Smits & Denis, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Smits-Denis-2014-6e38d22ebad343ee9a69ed28998a7708?pvs=21)), many states installed funding agencies like the NHS or the ERC to distribute, oversee and audit the public funds allocated to research, making it more fitting into broader marketization practices. Those agencies have become important entities in the scientific system: ‚Äúthey seem to resemble banks in the economic system: they are investing money into promising projects or are giving credits to trustworthy and (hopefully) innovative scientists. Like banks they have to make sure they are choosing among the right projects and scientists in order to not forego their `capital return'."([Braun, 1998](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Braun-1998-5ff288d6f7ec47bc9c3fd3cdec8b44ae?pvs=21), p. 811)In order to do this, they evaluate project proposals, award research grants and sometimes have their own independent research institutions, for instance the [national cancer institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) of the NHS. Funds from private sources and funds from funding agencies are often taken together under the term ‚ÄúThird Party Funding‚Äù, also because private entities rather contribute funds to research agencies, rather than ti researchers directly. Third-party funding has become an important pillar of university finances, as well as for scientific careers. Ulrike Felt describes this in the context of Austrian Universities: ‚Äúresearch without third-party funding is now virtually impossible, and the acquisition of projects has become a key indicator of the success of a university, a faculty, a discipline or an individual researcher‚Äù ([Felt, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2017-cbcdcb1df1244a3d83f4531b2091d9c3?pvs=21), p. 55).

Along with the changes in source and distribution of funds, also the evaluative criteria for obtaining funding have shifted. The hallmarks of this transition are ‚Äúmovement toward output or performance-based funding; continuing interest in setting objectives and priorities at the national level; use of performance assessments; and greater focus on efficiency, quality and accountability‚Äù [Fr√∏lich et al., 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fr-lich-et-al-2010-79ba80538d054df98cd9b32ce359187e?pvs=21), p. 19). Hence, from an input-model, allocating money on the basis of indicators such as staff or student numbers, the funding criteria have become more and more output-oriented, relying for instance on published papers or number of awarded degrees. These changes in funding structures towards market-logics, shifts the focus from knowledge production to (measurable) output and performance, which firstly has to be clearly defined on the governmental level, meaning less room for exploratory research and an even increased reliance on [[Metrics and Indicators]] ([Felt, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2017-cbcdcb1df1244a3d83f4531b2091d9c3?pvs=21)).

These changes have a profound impact on the abilities of Universities to teach students critical thinking ([Morris et al., 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Morris-et-al-2023-dabae5f89ac9487a928b911ad93b985a?pvs=21)) and how knowledge is produced. Some of the impacts in this regard are discussed in the subnodes ([[Projectification]], [[Focus on Novelty, Excellence and High Risk-High Reward]]), others can be found in the periphery of this node ([[Market Logics in Universities]] [[Changes in the Academic Workforce - tenure, projectification and part-time]] [[Technology Transfer and Academic Capitalism]] [[Competition]])
