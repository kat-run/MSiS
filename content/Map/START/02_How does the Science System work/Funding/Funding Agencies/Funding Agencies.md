**Abstract/Summary**

Most evidently, a market-orientation of the epistemic system has had impacts on the source of funding. Whereas in the post-war period, universities were mostly funded directly by the state and allocated the money autonomously within the institution. Employees were mostly tenured hence stayed at one institution for long periods of time. In the US, starting in the 1980s, along with the wave of privatization and the era of trickle-down-economics, the sources of funding shifted steadily from public to private sources and public-private partnerships were encouraged by policy makers. An example for this is the Bayh-Doyle act from 1980 which allows patenting of discoveries by Universities, making collaborations with the private sector easier and shifting the focus from discovery to the marketability of research ([Mirowski, 2011](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mirowski-2011-52e3e8247a3a495e8aaa1c878effe839?pvs=21)). In Europe this shift in funding happens at a later stage but its dynamics are similar. In liaison with the ‚ÄúBologna process‚Äù which aimed at standardizing the European higher education system, and the emergence of the European single market, also a ‚Äúneo-liberal language of economic competitiveness in higher education policies at the European level‚Äù ([Robertson & Keeling, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Robertson-Keeling-2008-07aeef7a332e4147bcc115c60179e2a7?pvs=21), p. 222) took root and European institutions shifted the funding structure from a state-centered model towards a more market-oriented model in similar a line than the US with a new focus on mixed funding, [[Projectification]] and strengthening relations with industry. For instance, in Austria in 2021 more than 50% of research funding was derived from private sources ([Svensson-Jajko, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Svensson-Jajko-2022-ba002144ff5d45598ba576f473c7ad10?pvs=21)).
