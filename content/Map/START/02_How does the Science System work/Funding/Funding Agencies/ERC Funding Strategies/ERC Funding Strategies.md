**Abstract/Summary**

The European Research Council (ERC) is the first pan- European funding body designed to support investigator-driven frontier research and stimulate scientific excellence across Europe.  
Under the EU research programme “Horizon 2020”, the ERC has a total budget of over €13 billion for the period 2014-2020 available for researchers.  
The ERC aims to support the best and most creative scientists to identify and explore new opportunities and directions in any field of research (Physical Sciences and Engineering, Life Sciences and Social Sciences and Humanities), without thematic priorities. In particular, it encourages proposals which cross disciplinary boundaries; address new and emerging fields; and introduce unconventional and innovative approaches.  
The ERC awards long-term grants to researchers of any nationality and age from anywhere in the world who wish to carry out their research projects in a host organization based in Europe. Scientific excellence is the sole evaluation criterion.
