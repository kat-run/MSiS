Scientists are increasingly overwhelmed by the volume of articles being published. Total  
articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science have grown exponentially in recent years; in  
2022 the article total was ~47% higher than in 2016, which has outpaced the limited growth ‚Äì  
if any ‚Äì in the number of practising scientists. Thus, publication workload per scientist (writing,  
reviewing, editing) has increased dramatically. We define this problem as ‚Äúthe strain on  
scientific publishing.‚Äù To analyse this strain, we present five data-driven metrics showing  
publisher growth, processing times, and citation behaviours. We draw these data from web  
scrapes, requests for data from publishers, and material that is freely available through  
publisher websites. Our findings are based on millions of papers produced by leading  
academic publishers. We find specific groups have disproportionately grown in their articles  
published per year, contributing to this strain. Some publishers enabled this growth by  
adopting a strategy of hosting ‚Äúspecial issues,‚Äù which publish articles with reduced turnaround  
times. Given pressures on researchers to ‚Äúpublish or perish‚Äù to be competitive for funding  
applications, this strain was likely amplified by these offers to publish more articles. We also  
observed widespread year-over-year inflation of journal impact factors coinciding with this  
strain, which risks confusing quality signals. Such exponential growth cannot be sustained.  
The metrics we define here should enable this evolving conversation to reach actionable  
solutions to address the strain on scientific publishing.  

Based on an analysis of millions papers in the Scimago archive, and our own web-scraping, we highlight five trends:

1. Article growth comes from numerous publishers, both those who sell journals via subscription and by those who levy article processing charges on gold open access papers (Fig.2A).
2. Some publishers‚Äô turnaround times (from paper submission to article publication) have become short and homogenous. We would expect them to be diverse because papers‚Äô needs are different.
3. More articles can also be created by lowering rejection rates. But there are no clear trends in rejection rates across the sector. Our modelling showed that the best predictor of patterns in rejection rates was the publisher.
4. Special Issues are a major driver of growth among some (but not all) gold open access publishers. We found that Special Issues are also associated with lower rejection rates and more homogenous turnaround times.
5. By comparing different measures of impact factor we could show that there has been impact inflation across the sector by all publishers (Fig.2B). This is a classic case of¬†[Goodhart¬¥s law in operation](http://tinyurl.com/2mdm5f26).
