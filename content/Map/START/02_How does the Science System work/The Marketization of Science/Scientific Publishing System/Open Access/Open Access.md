Almost 30 years ago, the Open Access movement developed out of criticism of the rising prices for access to scientific publications and the realization that in the conventional publishing system at least three times public funds flow into publication. This was driven in particular by concerned librarians and scientists. In this report, the term Open Access refers primarily to the definition of the Budapest Open Access Initiative and the claim that the results of publicly funded research should be publicly accessible: ‚ÄúOpen Access means that this literature should be free and publicly available on the Internet so that interested parties can read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, reference and otherwise use the full texts in any legal way, without financial, legal or technical barriers beyond those associated with Internet access itself. In all matters of reprinting and distribution, and in all matters of copyright in general, the only restriction should be to allow authors to retain control over their work and to ensure their right to have their work properly acknowledged and cited. ‚Äú10 Today, the claim of Open Access is extended from classical scientific publications to research data, methods or software.

1 **Gold OA:** immediate, unlimited, free access to the publication at the original place of publication in the original version under an open license The golden road refers to the first publication in an OA journal or platform, as an OA monograph or in an OA anthology following a standard quality assurance process (e.g. peer review). A publication contract regulates the rights of use and the necessary licenses. Open Access journals are financed either by fees (for readers or authors), by institutions or by consortia. Publication fees (Article Processing Charges, APCs) are paid by the authors for approx. 30 % of all quality-checked Gold OA journals11. Similarly, book processing charges (BPCs) are levied for OA monographs. A variant of Gold OA is called Hybrid OA. Here, articles from subscription journals are optionally made freely accessible for a fee. However, this variant is very controversial, as fees are charged twice: through APCs and subscriptions/licenses (double dipping).  
2. the platinum or diamond route of Open Access** refers to the special route of the golden model of institutionally or jointly financed publication platforms or publishers. It usually enables OA journals that can be read free of charge and do not charge APCs to authors. Any costs incurred are borne by professional societies, research institutions, universities or funding bodies (sponsored OA). This approach is largely based on the commitment of those involved, which is often voluntary. Institutions support these publication services both financially and with infrastructure, e.g. through software and hosting of Open Journal Systems (OJS), as well as with human resources, e.g. in libraries or IT departments.

**Green OA:** open access (secondary) publication of a publication on a repository under an open license for an unlimited period of time The green route refers to the secondary publication or self-archiving of scientific literature or data - before or after the publication of the final version or ‚Äúversion of record‚Äù. This secondary publication of published articles can take place in institutional, interdisciplinary or subject-specific repositories in the form of postprints. Repositories are document servers operated by research institutions on which scientific information is archived and made accessible worldwide free of charge. The content of the postprint corresponds to that of the accepted version, but as a rule may not contain any publisher-specific formatting and may usually only be made publicly accessible after a time delay (‚Äúembargo period‚Äù). This form of secondary publication is also legally enshrined in Austrian copyright law12. 4 Although preprints are also published OA on repositories, i.e. they are considered OA publications, they are not counted as part of the green OA route, as these documents have not yet undergone a formal peer review process.

  

(KR) Another argument in favor of open access is equality and the north-south disparity of access to scientific literature. If the institution lacks the money for licenses, researchers have access to less information, relevant for their research, hence impeding their research process.
