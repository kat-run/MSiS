**Abstract/Summary**

In 2016, the [Expert Group "National Strategy" of the Open Access Network Austria (OANA)](https://zenodo.org/search?q=metadata.creators.person_or_org.name%3A%22Expert+Group+%22National+Strategy%22+of+the+Open+Access+Network+Austria+(OANA)%22) consisting of some of Austria‚Äôs leading scientists, as representatives of their respective institutions, called for all research papers produced in Austria to be freely available by 2025.

The Initiative was backed by the main Austrian funding agencies, the [Ministry of Economy and Research (BMBWF)](https://www.bmbwf.gv.at/Themen/HS-Uni/Hochschulgovernance/Leitthemen/Digitalisierung/Open-Science.html#:~:text=Das%20Open%20Science%20Network%20Austria%20) and added to the [coalition program](https://www.dievolkspartei.at/Download/Regierungsprogramm_2020.pdf) in 2020 (see below), hence, there was a broad coalition to back the issue.

This is a summary of their suggestions [Bauer et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bauer-et-al-2016-2ab06bbd07a04cd5a1af948940f371ec?pvs=21) :

> By 2025, a large part of all scholarly publication activity in Austria should be Open Access. In other words, the final versions of most scholarly publications (in particular all refereed journal articles and conference proceedings) resulting from the support of public resources must be freely accessible on the Internet without delay (Gold Open Access). This goal should be pursued by taking into account the different disciplinary practices and under consideration of the different disciplinary priorisations of Open Access. The resources required to meet this obligation shall be provided to the authors, or the cost of the publication venues shall be borne directly by the research organisations. The necessary funding must be brought in line with the overall funding priorities for research.  

  

In 2018, a push towards open access was also pursued on the European Level by ‚ÄúScience Europe‚Äù the organization which represents the mayor funding bodies in the European Union. The Project [‚ÄúcOAlition Plan S‚Äú](https://www.scienceeurope.org/our-priorities/open-access/) aimed to have all European works of research published with open access by 2021.

  

These goals could not be met but the numbers of publicly availablle papers has steadyly risen. In 2021, one in four papers (25%) of the participating institutions (including Austria) was still behind paywalls [cOAlition S, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/cOAlition-S-2021-e4adc848ca4c41359b6c0db05cec8062?pvs=21), [Mayer, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mayer-2022-0da355c9c0bf4e8486eb72d04a96dc87?pvs=21).

[Mayer, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mayer-2022-0da355c9c0bf4e8486eb72d04a96dc87?pvs=21) sees the main reason for the remaining for-profit publication in lacking oversight by the funding bodies, as well as some smaller funding agencies (e.g. FFG) not participating in the initiative.
