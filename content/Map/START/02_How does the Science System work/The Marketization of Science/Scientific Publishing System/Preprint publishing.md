NOTE: While there are many studies which examine part of the effects of preprints, to date, there is no comprehensive study on how the practice of publishing papers on preprint servers is changing science.

**Abstract/Summary**

> Preprints form part of the open scholarship landscape and exist in parallel to traditional journal articles – the key difference is that preprints may not be submitted for peer-review

[Chiarelli et al., 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Chiarelli-et-al-2019-f55f4c36f32249c9a6cb04755f903958?pvs=21) → **Comprehensive report on the rise and the development of preprint publishing**

Emerging in the field of Physics, preprint servers, such as arXiv, quickly began to gain popularity in the second decade of the new millennium. In the early days of the platform however, most papers published as preprints, eventually ended up in the peer-review process ([Gunnarsdóttir, 2012](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gunnarsd-ttir-2012-1d6f0e40d9e6400c96a9b4748c9d3867?pvs=21)). By 2016, preprint servers were used as a standard means of distribution in the field of high-energy physics by experimentalists as well as theoretical physicists. [Delfanti, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Delfanti-2016-0144403989904b7fb61757d03cdeadff?pvs=21)) emphasizes the advantage in terms of speed and ease of sharing information which works well in a tight-knit field such as high-energy Physics.

While it started to become a more common practice outside of physics, especially in disciplines, where time pressure is a factor, the main driver of the recent surge in preprint papers was the Covid 19 pandemic. Mainly in the biomedical sciences, preprints have also become a common practice with widespread implications. A study of over 5000 Covid-related papers published on BioarXiv, showed that only 5.7% were subsequently published in peer reviewed journals ([Añazco et al., 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/A-azco-et-al-2021-24ab73cbe6bb48ad9599a8c9accbff41?pvs=21) ). Another study found a considerable amount of difference between results, published in preprint articles compared to their later appearance in scientific journals. Only 1/3 of the examined papers were unchanged ([Bero et al., 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bero-et-al-2021-61743fca7e004e83a1e6bd102a69ebc1?pvs=21)). This can be interpreted as preprint servers being a more transparent depiction of the research process insofar as the correction loops and changes, which are an inherent feature of preprints ([Bu et al., 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bu-et-al-2020-f3041d9f38f342faa76f1ec29216c16e?pvs=21)), are hidden in traditional scientific publications, where papers are published only after peer review (see also the publication strategy of the [[eLife Journal]]). In this regard, also a high number of peer-reviewed articles had to be retracted during the pandemic [Yeo-Teh & Tang, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Yeo-Teh-Tang-2021-53c82c06d1334406a7a6c00cf88bd59a?pvs=21).

The publication of preprints also has effects on public dissemination of research with the public often not aware of the difference between peer reviewed journals and non-peer reviewed preprints ([Wingen et al., 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wingen-et-al-2022-44327650e5c147cb830dc7a6253e2bd3?pvs=21)).

  

> If we survive to see a world without academic journals, it will not be because preprints won the ‘battle’. It will be because a ‘new generation’ of research communication will meet the demand of the time. But, for now, preprints are not going to replace journals.
