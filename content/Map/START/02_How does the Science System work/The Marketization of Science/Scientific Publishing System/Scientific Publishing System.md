### _Publish or Perish_

> _“Im herkömmlichen Publikationssystem fließen gleich dreimal öffentliche Gelder in eine Veröffentlichung: 1) Forschende werden meist aus öffentlichen Mitteln bezahlt. 2) Bei der Veröffentlichung ihrer Ergebnisse durchlaufen die Publikationen Qualitätssicherungsverfahren, wie z. B. ein Peer-Review-Verfahren. Die Begutachtung übernehmen andere Wissenschaftler*innen – in der Regel, ohne dafür von den Verlagen oder Zeitschriften entlohnt zu werden. 3) Schließlich müssen Bibliotheken und Institute die Zeitschriften und Bücher von den Verlagen abonnieren bzw. erwerben, um sie den Angehörigen ihrer Einrichtungen zur Verfügung stellen zu können.”_

The review is carried out by other researchers - usually without being paid by the publishers or journals. 3) Finally, libraries and institutes must subscribe to or purchase the journals and books from the publishers in order to make them available to members of their institutions."_

### How does the system work? (Chat GPT)

The current academic publication system involves several key steps and stakeholders that ensure the dissemination of scholarly research. Here's an overview of how it typically works:

1. **Research and Manuscript Preparation**:
    - Researchers conduct studies and experiments, gather data, and analyze their results.
    - They write a manuscript detailing their methodology, findings, and conclusions. This often includes drafting multiple versions and receiving feedback from colleagues.
2. **Journal Selection and Submission**:
    - Authors select a suitable academic journal based on the scope and impact factor of the journal. Journals can be specialized or interdisciplinary and vary in prestige.
    - Manuscripts are submitted through the journal's online submission system, where authors must adhere to specific formatting and submission guidelines.
3. **Peer Review**:
    - Once submitted, the journal editor reviews the manuscript to ensure it fits the journal’s scope and standards.
    - **The manuscript is then sent to experts in the field (peers) for review. This process is typically double-blind, meaning neither the authors nor the reviewers know each other's identities, to ensure unbiased feedback.**
    - **Reviewers evaluate the manuscript for originality, validity, methodology, and significance of the research. They provide recommendations: accept, revise, or reject.**
4. **Revisions and Resubmission**:
    - Based on reviewers' feedback, authors revise their manuscript to address any critiques or suggestions.
    - The revised manuscript may go through multiple rounds of review and revision before it is accepted.
5. **Publication**:
    - Once accepted, the manuscript goes through copyediting, proofreading, and typesetting.
    - The final version is published in the journal, either in print, online, or both. Many journals now offer open access options, allowing anyone to read the article without a subscription.
6. **Post-Publication**:
    
    - After publication, the research can be widely disseminated and cited by other researchers.
    - Metrics such as citation counts, impact factors, and altmetrics are used to measure the impact and reach of the research.
    
    **Stakeholders in the Academic Publication System**
    
    - **Authors**: Researchers and scholars who conduct studies and write manuscripts.
    - **Reviewers**: Experts who evaluate the quality and validity of submitted manuscripts.
    - **Editors**: Individuals who manage the peer review process and make final decisions on manuscript acceptance.
    - **Publishers**: Organizations that produce and distribute academic journals.
    - **Libraries and Institutions**: Entities that subscribe to journals and provide access to researchers and students.
    - **Funding Agencies**: Organizations that fund research and often require results to be published in peer-reviewed journals.

**Challenges and Trends**

- **Open Access**: Increasing demand for free access to research articles, leading to the rise of open access journals.
- **Publication Fees**: Many open access journals charge authors publication fees, which can be a barrier for some researchers.
- **Peer Review Quality**: Ensuring the integrity and thoroughness of the peer review process remains a critical challenge.
- **Preprints**: The use of preprint servers where researchers can share their findings before peer review is becoming more common, especially in fast-moving fields like medicine and technology.
