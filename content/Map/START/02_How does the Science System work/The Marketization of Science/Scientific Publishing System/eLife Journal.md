**Abstract/Summary (Perplexity)**

eLife is a biomedical and Life science Journal which was founded to counteract the current publication system and provide a high-impact open-access journal.

**Their mission statement:**

eLife is committed to creating a future where a diverse, global community of scientists and researchers shares open and trusted results for the benefit of all. To achieve this, we are developing a new model of publishing that puts preprints first and emphases public reviews and assessments of research. This system makes sharing of research faster and fairer, while still providing robust peer review and quality assessment.

In 2022 the journal introduced a whole new revisions system in which papers can no longer be rejected during the review process. Instead every paper, which gets sent out to reviewers is published as a preprint alongside the reviewers suggestions. The authors then have the choice to review them and resubmit or leave it like that.

Detailed description of the new publishing model (Perplexity AI)

eLife's preprint model differs from traditional publishing methods in several key ways:

1. **Peer Review and Publication**:
    - **Traditional Method**: In traditional publishing, peer review is followed by a binary accept/reject decision. If accepted, the paper is published in a journal, and the peer reviews are typically not shared publicly.
    - **eLife Model**: eLife's model combines the speed and transparency of preprints with the scrutiny of expert peer review. All reviewed papers are published as Reviewed Preprints on the eLife website, accompanied by public reviews and editorial assessments. Authors can then choose to revise and resubmit their papers, with each revised version published alongside the public reviews and assessments[1][2][3].
2. **Author Control**:
    - **Traditional Method**: In traditional publishing, the editor and reviewers decide when a paper is published.
    - **eLife Model**: In eLife's model, the author has more control over the publishing process. They can choose to publish their reviewed preprint as a final Version of Record at any point during the iterative process, and they can also decide whether to resubmit a revised version or declare the current version as the final Version of Record[2][3].
3. **Public Reviews and Assessments**:
    - **Traditional Method**: Public reviews and assessments are not typically shared in traditional publishing.
    - **eLife Model**: eLife's model makes public reviews and assessments available alongside the Reviewed Preprints. This allows readers to assess the research based on its merits rather than where it is published[2][3].
4. **Faster Publication**:
    - **Traditional Method**: Traditional publishing can be slow, with multiple rounds of review and resubmission.
    - **eLife Model**: eLife's model aims to speed up the process by publishing Reviewed Preprints within a few weeks of the authors receiving the reviews. This allows peer-reviewed research to be available to read, cite, and share more quickly[3].
5. **Open-Access and Transparency**:
    - **Traditional Method**: Traditional publishing often involves a subscription-based model, limiting access to research.
    - **eLife Model**: eLife is an open-access journal, publishing all content free and immediately to a worldwide audience. This promotes transparency and increases access to research[3].

These changes aim to make the scientific publishing process more efficient, equitable, and transparent, ultimately benefiting the scientific community and the dissemination of research findings.

**The potential drawbacks of eLife's new publishing model include:**

1. **Potential Bias in Editorial Decisions**:
    - **Editorial Triage**: The model still relies on editorial triage, which may lead to biases in selecting papers for review. This could disadvantage early-career researchers and minority scientists without strong social networks or reputations[1]. **This is also true for traditional for-profit journals (KR)**
2. **Risk of Low-Quality Work Being Published**:
    - **Lack of Acceptance/Rejection Decisions**: Without accept/reject decisions, there is a risk that low-quality work might be published without proper scrutiny. This could dilute the quality of the scientific literature and undermine the credibility of the journal[2][3].
3. **Impact on the Value of Peer Reviews**:
    - **Public Reviews**: The model makes public reviews available alongside the preprints. This could lead to concerns that the value of peer reviews is being diminished, as they are no longer used solely for accept/reject decisions[2][3].
4. **Potential for Biases in Public Reviews**:
    - **Constructive Feedback**: While the model aims to encourage constructive feedback, there is still a risk that public reviews could contain biases or negative comments that might harm the authors' reputations[1].
5. **Author Control and Responsibility**:
    - **Author Decision-Making**: The model gives authors more control over the publishing process, but this could lead to concerns about the responsibility of authors in ensuring the quality and accuracy of their work[2][3].
6. **Potential for Overemphasis on Preprints**:
    - **Preprint Culture**: The model's focus on preprints could lead to an overemphasis on preprints, potentially overshadowing the importance of peer-reviewed publications and the rigorous process they entail[3].
7. **Initial Skepticism and Resistance**:
    - **Community Reaction**: The initial reactions from the scholarly community have been mixed, with some expressing concerns about the potential drawbacks of the new model. This could lead to resistance to the change and a slower adoption rate[2][3].

These potential drawbacks highlight the need for careful consideration and ongoing evaluation of the new model to ensure its long-term success and the integrity of the scientific publishing process.
