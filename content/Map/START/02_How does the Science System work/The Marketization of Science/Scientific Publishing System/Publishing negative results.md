Concerns that the growing competition for funding and citations might distort science are frequently discussed, but have not been verified directly. Of the hypothesized problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative results not only distorts the scientific literature directly, but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study analyzed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have ‘‘tested’’ a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive support has grown by over 22% between 1990 and 2007, with significant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom). Methodological artifacts cannot explain away these patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with which results are produced and published is decreasing.

Scientists face challenges in publishing negative results, because most scientific journals are biased in accepting positive and novel findings. Despite their importance, negative results often go unpublished, leading to duplication of efforts, biased meta-analyses, and ethical concerns regarding animal and human studies. In this light, the initiative by _Access Microbiology_ to collect and publish negative results in the field of microbiology is a very important and valuable contribution towards unbiased science.

  

**Positive effects of changing the culture and publishing also negative results (****[Bik, 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bik-2024-817bf88258e3421788aec820769c07a7?pvs=21)** **[Mlinarić et al., 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mlinari-et-al-2017-179ab9c43d934cdcb07b8df518d3c2da?pvs=21)****)**

- Saves research effort and money by avoiding repeating experiments with negative results
- Meta-analyses would get more precise and less biased
- There is an ethical responsibility to publish data from animal and human participant studies, even (and maybe especially) if the results are negative or inconclusive
- If public funds were used to finance the research, there is a responsibility to let the public know where the funds were spent.
- If more studies that replicate results and fail to do so are published, this might mitigate the [[Replication (crisis)]].
- It might change the valuation practices of science. Rather than rewarding results and productivity ([Fochler et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fochler-et-al-2016-ad0d5bd0a02b4a6dbd76470719c25638?pvs=21)), scientific rigor and effort, regardless of outcome, might be increasingly valued. As a consequence, it could enhance the focus on quality over quantity in research and take out some of the pressure in the system.

  

> After a new paradigm is proposed, the peer-review process is tilted toward positive results. But then, after a few years, the academic incentives shift—the paradigm has become entrenched—so that the most notable results are now those that disprove the theory.
