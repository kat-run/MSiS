**Abstract/Summary (Elzinga, 2010)**

In many countries - during the past three decades - there has been increasing alignment of public administration with neoliberal modes of governance driven by processes of globalization and privatization. Key is New Public Management (NPM) as an instrument for applying private sector or market-based techniques to public services. The paper concerns the implications and impact of these developments as they relate to the university sector where we are seeing an influx of bibliometrics to assess performativity with measures that are frequently far from adequate. These changes are related to the broader context of a globalized privatization doctrine of science policy that has gained currency in many countries. The analysis presented here probes and discusses a nexus between NPM, bibliometric performance audits, and a new paradigm in science policy. As such the paper seeks to fill an important gap in science policy studies and the literature on New Public Management more generally. It summarizes various characteristics associated with NPM, and explicates the connection with methods of research evaluation now being introduced in academic institutions. It also takes up varying responses evoked within academe by the use of bibliometrics and current methods of ranking of tertiary educational institutions. Apart from gaining a better understanding of significant changes in the higher educational and research landscapes or disciplines and the interplay of these with broader economic and political trends in society at large, the aim of the paper is also to stimulate discussion and debate on current priorities, perceptions and policies governing knowledge production.

‚ÄúTaken together these changes signify a more explicit focus on universities as contributors of a global knowledge economy and therefore, increasingly a justification predicated on economics (Miller and LeBoeuf 2009; Christensen and Eyring 2011), less educational grounds (Docherty 2011; Freedman 2011). Concurrently, universities are challenged to cultivate more substantive and fluent relationships with their public communities and a public interface that exceeds the expectations, conventions and parameters of the university‚Äôs (previously) predominant role as educational provider‚Äù

‚ÄúThese radical reformers are also attempting to restructure how higher education is organized. In doing so, they are putting in place modes of governance that mimic corporate structures by  
increasing the power of administrators at the expense of faculty, reducing  
faculty to a mostly temporary and low-wage workforce, and reducing  
students to customers‚Äîripe for being trained for low-skilled jobs and at-risk  
for incurring large student loans.‚Äù  

‚ÄúAnother characteristic of this crushing  
form of economic Darwinism is that it thrives on a kind of social amnesia  
that erases critical thought, historical analysis, and any understanding of  
broader systemic relations. In this regard, it does the opposite of critical  
memory work by eliminating those public spheres where people learn to  
translate private troubles into public issues. That is, it breaks ‚Äúthe link  
between public agendas and private worries, the very hub of the democratic  
process.‚Äù
