**Abstract/Summary**

> “What is new about the current threat to higher education and the humanities in particular is the increasing pace of the corporatization and militarization of the university, the squelching of academic freedom, the rise of an ever increasing contingent of part-time faculty, the rise of a bloated manegerial class, and the view that students are basically consumers and faculty providers of a saleable commodity such as a credential or a set of workplace skills. More striking still is the slow death of the university as a center of critique, vital source of civic education, and crucial public good.” [Giroux, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Giroux-2014-20c30865408446ddb6d170071f45f881?pvs=21)

  

> When students become valued clients instead of learners, they gain a great deal of self-esteem, but precious little knowledge; worse, they do not develop the habits of critical thinking that would allow them to continue to learn and to evaluate the kinds of complex issues on which they will have to deliberate and vote as citizens. ([Nichols, 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Nichols-2024-2163faf0e68642bdbf66be799693a0db?pvs=21), p. 9)
