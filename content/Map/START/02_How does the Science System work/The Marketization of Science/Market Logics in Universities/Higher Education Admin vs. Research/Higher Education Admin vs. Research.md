**Abstract/Summary**

Since the beginning 1990s a change in the higher education system seems to be ongoing, which think tanks like the Goldwater Institute or the Antonin Scalia law School of Mandison University call an “Administrative Bloat” In the US, the number of college students has risen by 15% (Greene, 2010). This increase in numbers mainly caused an increase in administrative personnel and only to a lesser extend in teaching personnel: “Between 1993 and 2007, the number of full-time administrators per 100 students at America’s leading universities grew by 39 percent, while the number of employees engaged in teaching, research or service only grew by 18 percent” (Greene, 2010).

The development has only accelerated since then and several think tanks (liberal as well as conservative) see it as a problem: “On average, the top universities in the U.S. have only 1 faculty member per 11 students. 9 By contrast, these same institutions have 1 non faculty employee per 4 students. Put another way, there are now 3 times as many non-faculty as there are faculty per student at the best schools in the U.S.” [Weinstein, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Weinstein-2023-9de9408661b144ed95383fb122a15b48?pvs=21)

Interestingly the reasons for the bloat seem to be multiple and it depends on the ideological leaning of the authors, which ones are the main culprits. The following list contains all the reasons gathered from various reports and research articles.

1. The “Administrative bloat” is caused by Universities (especially in the US) changing funding structure. Large endowments, donations, corporate sponsorships, short-term grants require financial professionals who oversee spending, reinvest, audit, etc.
2. The “Administrative Bloat” is caused by changes in technology and research infrastructure: Digital infrastructures in IT, Libraries, machinery etc. require personnel who set up and maintain it.
3. The “Administrative Bloat” is caused by an increasing number of positions in the field of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (Link to Ethics Committees in Australia) [Greene, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Greene-2021-5fbbab325360496aa1bd0b201502cfc3?pvs=21),
4. The “Administrative Bloat” is caused by an increasing emphasis on student support and job placement efforts [Weinstein, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Weinstein-2023-9de9408661b144ed95383fb122a15b48?pvs=21)
5. The “Administrative Bloat” is caused by a changing of the University’s self understanding. In the last decades it became more open to the general public, hence, more professional science communicators, outreach specialists, alumni organizers, event organizers are required:n “the enactment of expanded and diversified missions of HE is one of the main factors nurturing universities’ professional and administrative bodies” [Baltaru & Soysal, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Baltaru-Soysal-2018-365f1a63e5aa4a2bb1091fec77ab80dd?pvs=21) p. 213)
6. The “Administrative Bloat” is caused by competition for students. More efforts are put into marketing, social clubs, infrastructure, etc.
7. The “Administrative Bloat” is caused by increased regulation such as safety and security measures and compliance practices for receiving public funds: “schools have experienced an explosion in regulation and red tape, which is driven partly by federal and state governments” [Weinstein, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Weinstein-2023-9de9408661b144ed95383fb122a15b48?pvs=21)

The following graph (numbers taken from [Weinstein, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Weinstein-2023-9de9408661b144ed95383fb122a15b48?pvs=21) is indicating the numbers from 2022. The dot size indicates the number of total students, the colorindicates the faculty/non-faculty ratio, meaning, the redder the dot, the lower the number of faculty compared to non-faculty (size is total student number).
