**Abstract/Summary**

A relatively new focus in contemporary academia and amongst broader marketization tendencies is the transfer of knowledge from academic research to the private market. For instance, biomedical discoveries are made at a research institution and developed further in a start-up company, often marketed as a so-called “spin-off”, suggesting a strong link between the home institution and the private entity. Universities benefit from this process by profiting from potential gains and positive publicity; the start-ups or spin-offs benefit by being able to utilize the research and sometimes the infrastructure of the academic institution, as well as having a direct access to potential employees and ideas.
