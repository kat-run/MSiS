**Abstract/Summary**

Abstract Pielke & Byerly, 1998

Science policy implements a social contract. In the US since World War II, this arrangement has amounted to society—through government—giving science both money and relative autonomy while, in return, reaping the practical benefits that inevitably result. ==The arrangement once may have been appropriate, but it no longer is; we now need a new understanding of how science serves national needs. The separation of science from society is today seen as artificial and unsustainable. The scientific community needs to negotiate a new contract with the society that funds it.==

Abstract Bentley et al., 2015

What is the central research activity in modern universities? This paper uses a comprehensive survey among individuals from 15 countries to map differences in orientation towards basic/fundamental research, applied/practical research and a combination of the two. ==Despite some claims in the literature that basic research is no longer a preoccupation of universities, our findings point at a continued strong presence of basic research in universities but with large variations between countries and academic disciplines. At the individual level, most academics engage in a combination of basic and applied research, rather than specialising, with applied orientations generally more common.== ==Academics specialising in basic research tend to receive less external funding, work in environments where applied research is less emphasised and hold weaker professional obligations to apply their knowledge to problems in society.==
