together with the growing power of metrics and evaluation, this ‘chronopolitics’ [(Felt, 2017b)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?B0A5e3) provides a rigid temporal- and material regime, especially for early-stage research careers.

international experience have become a requirement for building a solid academic career [(Felt, 2009; Loveday, 2018)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?bsHnSx).

the journal _Nature_ referred to this as a “Postdoc pile up” [(Powell, 2015)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?3RCrbT). This imbalance causes a state of “Hyper-competition” ([Fochler et al., 2016)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?jYY704) between the early- and mid-stage researchers, which causes an ever more narrow definition of what aspects are valued in a scientific career and what aspects are not.

the worth of individuals is defined by their ability to succeed in competition based on productivity in terms of acquiring internationally accepted and transferable tokens of academic quality, that is, indexed publications, grant money and recorded citations” [(Fochler et al., 2016, p. 196)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?ZDznZC).
