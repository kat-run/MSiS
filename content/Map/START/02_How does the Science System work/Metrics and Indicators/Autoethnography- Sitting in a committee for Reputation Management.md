**Abstract/Summary**

**With this little exercise in autoethnography, I want to show the power of numbers and how they tacitly seep into every process of University governance.**

In 2022, in my role as science communicator of the Faculty of Life Sciences at the University of Vienna, I was asked to take part in a committee for establishing a university-wide strategy for ‚Äúreputation management‚Äù with the goal of attracting and keeping excellent international staff and students. In the committee were several other communication experts from the University-wide communication department, some tech-transfer experts, managers from the rectorate and some other faculties. I did not fully understand why I was invited and what reputation management actually meant (I was not alone in this sentiment, as some other participants expressed at the beginning of the first meeting).

Reputation management, explained the head of communication, is a new project, initiated by the rectorate. The university, one of the largest in Europe, was not recognized enough for their excellence and not well known on an international level. The placement on the ‚Äú[THE ranking](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings)‚Äù has been getting better every year, but the University was still not under the top 100. Since reputation and visibility are large factors in the ranking, it was crucial to make the University more visible on an international scale. After talking in detail about this ranking, it was important for her to stress that these numbers really don‚Äôt matter but we still need to improve them because that is what everybody does. In the discussion that follows, all participants, me included, aired their frustrations about this, but still fully subjected to it because it was the only solid indicator we had for assessing the reputation of our institution. Therefore, even though we knew the ranking was not reflecting reality, we continued elaborating targeted measures for reputation management with the ranking in mind. Hence, the ranking was still used, even though we agreed that it was not useful.

At some point one of the other participants asked the question why every University in the world needed to be put in a single ranking and why it was so important to us. Another participant gave the answer that it was important to show good numbers when it comes to budget negotiations. Policy makers, he argued, always want to see improvement in numbers, and charts that show upwards. In this environment of scarce funds, ‚Äúgood‚Äù numbers are needed.

Even though we all somehow agreed that a ranking was not what we desired the reputation to be defined with, the committee introduced another number that it would use to assess the effectiveness of our measure. Indicators, like the number of international alumni or the number of international citations, were compiled into an internal assessment strategy. So ironically a group of professionals who had talked extensively about the limited usefulness of numbers and how unfair the system of ranking is, in the end agreed to introduce a new internal indicator for the assessment of their own work.
