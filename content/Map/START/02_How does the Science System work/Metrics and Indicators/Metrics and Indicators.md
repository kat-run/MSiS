**Abstract/Summary**

Numbers are everywhere, not just in the epistemic world but also beyond. The growing trust in numbers is tightly interwoven with our modern knowledge society. Numbers, metrics and indicators tacitly shape our world by setting the rules while at the same time seeming to be objective ([Bowker & Star, 2000](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bowker-Star-2000-bd5a4f2504ba4399b30482b12d089002?pvs=21)). In other words: ‚ÄúQuantification is a way of making decisions without seeming to decide ([Porter, 1996](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Porter-1996-95c1505e72d740c2a0637fb9d17c21ee?pvs=21), p. 8)‚Äù.

There are a variety of metrics and indicators that are at work in the epistemic system, at the individual level, at the level of publications, at the institutional level, at the national level, at the transnational level and at the international level. All these means of quantification are interconnected and form a regime under which current knowledge production is subjected. There are multiple developments in the current science system, which promote heavy reliance on numbers to function and the reliance is only growing with the current marketized and globalized system.

First of all, numbers are required in a rapidly growing scientific community. In the last decades, science as a whole has grown in an exponential fashion (see for instance [Schatz, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schatz-2014-95253f822b424401b11efd55beeba9ec?pvs=21)). This makes the epistemic community, also in niche areas, harder to overlook. Hence, in order to ‚Äúget to know‚Äù their peers, scientists increasingly rely on personal metrics, such as citation, which can serve as a proxy for reputation in a certain field. Also at the level of universities, rankings like the [Times-Higher-Education-Ranking](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings), are used by prospective students, academics and investors to assess the quality of Universities. Along this line, metrics are needed in a globalized scientific community. As people and ideas are transported all over the globe and are taken up by different cultures of doing science and research, seemingly universal metrics and indicators serve as a means to integrate ideas and people, at the risk of one dominant culture suppressing the others (see for instance [Morley et al., 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Morley-et-al-2018-ecc66c5d9d7c46acbd24add2e9f1c579?pvs=21)).

Second, numbers and metrics are required in the quasi-market of ‚Äòepistemic capitalism‚Äô ([Fochler, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fochler-2016-e6c44c558c3747d4a7664021ecba6deb?pvs=21)), where funds are allocated in a performance-based manner ([Taylor et al., 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Taylor-et-al-2013-7f13d9a80a6e4fc0972779712885a407?pvs=21),[Fr√∏lich et al., 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fr-lich-et-al-2010-79ba80538d054df98cd9b32ce359187e?pvs=21)). In order to have the means to assess and compare research projects or scientists, seemingly objective metrics are seen as an adequate tool. The issue with this - and with comparing numbers and metrics in general- is the question of how those metrics are composed and who sets the standards with which the comparisons are made. For instance the aforementioned [THE-University-ranking](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/sites/default/files/the_2024_world_university_rankings_methodology.pdf) is calculated using other metrics, like citation impact factors, but also surveys that ask scientists for a ranking of ‚Äúreputation‚Äù of a certain institution, which is a rather subjective measure. By combining these different assessments, a seemingly objective number is produced, that has profound effects on Universities (for a comprehensive review, see [Gonzales & N√∫√±ez, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gonzales-N-ez-2021-71d5d116b1594633b85c8a4bdc6b4587?pvs=21))

Third, numbers and metrics serve as a means to assess, evaluate and as a consequence govern knowledge production and knowledge producers. [Bamberger & Kim, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bamberger-Kim-2023-9f0f971241824524836b7e698a647223?pvs=21), describe this process in the context of internationalization of South Korean Universities: ‚Äúas the employment of foreign academic faculty became another indicator for measuring the level of ‚Äòinternationalization‚Äô (e.g. QS ranking), there was a surge of international academic staff within domestic HEIs.‚Äù Only after the criterion of internationalization was turned into a metric, the institutions followed suit, hence the metric became a structuring element. Many different and nested metrics structure contemporary higher education along these logics: ‚ÄùWhereas once metrics were simply part of auditing process and, as such, functioned to ensure accountability they have, in more recent times, taken on another role, and now function as part of a process of, what has been called ‚Äòquantified control‚Äô‚Äù ([Burrows, 2012](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Burrows-2012-9f0bdeaa9958421fa779b8ba68804dad?pvs=21), p. 368). Meaning, metrics in the contemporary epistemic system serve as a sort of currency in the epistemic market which is supposed to unite different academic values and qualities, which are not necessarily quantifiable. By adopting these metrics, the epistemic community tacitly accepts this subjection to the commensurability of every aspect of epistemic life.

These shifting valuation practices have fundamentally changed the way the epistemic system functions starting at the institutional level: ‚Äúwithin institutions, increasingly, only those academic activities count that can be counted, whereas others are attributed less importance, need more work to make them visible or are even neglected‚Äù [Felt, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2016-36270d70e95f4705bc84d1e8a390b463?pvs=21), p. 58). This shift has consequences on how people situate themselves within the system and which kind of work is valued. For instance, it makes any kind of [[Care Work in Academia]] a liability. Besides changing institutions and shaping careers, a growing trust in metrics and indicators, changes how knowledge is produced: ‚ÄúAcademic value is, essentially, becoming monetized, and as this happens academic values are becoming transformed‚Äù ([Burrows, 2012](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Burrows-2012-9f0bdeaa9958421fa779b8ba68804dad?pvs=21), p. 368). The type of knowledge preferred by this logic needs to be fit into tight temporal regimes (see also [[Projectification]]) and be catered to the current [[Scientific Publishing System]]. It also needs to meet criteria of [[Focus on Novelty, Excellence and High Risk-High Reward]]. Taken together, knowledge production is ‚Äúshifting focus of academic work from a logic of discovery to one of delivery‚Äù ([Felt, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2017-cbcdcb1df1244a3d83f4531b2091d9c3?pvs=21), p. 53).

The question that remains is whether this knowledge is adequate to meet the multiple challenges which we are facing today or if ‚Äúthis might limit our future capacity to innovate in ways that fit broader societal values‚Äù ([Felt, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2017-cbcdcb1df1244a3d83f4531b2091d9c3?pvs=21), p. 53).
