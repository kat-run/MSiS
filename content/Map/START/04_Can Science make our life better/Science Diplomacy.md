**Abstract/Summary**

  

> Using CERN as a blueprint, global cooperation among scientists became one of UNESCO’s key missions and paved the way to support other institutions that combine scientific excellence with science diplomacy. Science diplomacy helps establish links and strengthen relations between societies, especially where there may not be another official approach.  Science is then used to strengthen or build links between countries that have tense or even non-existent relationships.
