**Summary (Source: ChatGPT)**

This article explores the impact of citizen science on environmental knowledge and policy, focusing on community-based air toxics monitoring using 'buckets' as a case study. It argues that the effectiveness of citizen science is shaped by standards and standardized practices. While standards can lend legitimacy to citizen-collected data, they also serve to dismiss it as irrelevant. The article emphasizes the importance of standard setting as a means to democratize science and policy-making processes.
