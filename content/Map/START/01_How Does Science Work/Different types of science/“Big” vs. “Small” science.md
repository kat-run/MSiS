**Abstract/Summary**

The contrast between "Big Science" and "Small Science" highlights a central challenge in how scientific research is funded and organized today. The rise of Big Science, characterized by large-scale funding, intensive resource allocation, and numerous regulations, has transformed science into a high-stakes enterprise driven by an exponential growth of both scientists and research findings. This shift has led to a scenario where every decade produces as many new scientists as have ever existed before [Schatz, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schatz-2014-95253f822b424401b11efd55beeba9ec). This exponential growth is a major challenge for funding agencies and inadvertendly intensifies competition for resources. Today‚Äôs scientists, unlike their predecessors in the mid-20th century, must navigate an intricate web of bureaucratic requirements (see also [Higher Education Admin vs. Research](https://www.notion.so/Higher-Education-Admin-vs-Research-005c23cc022a48aa8694de070b6d05f1?pvs=21)) and fierce competition, especially for prestigious positions and substantial grants. The increased [Focus on Novelty, Excellence and High Risk-High Reward](https://www.notion.so/Focus-on-Novelty-Excellence-and-High-Risk-High-Reward-9707af7088d74914851bd4f9cbb61d4a?pvs=21) further increases this sense of competition and scarcity, especially in the life-sciences. **So paradoxically, as science and research has gained societal impact and more money was funneled in the scientific pursuit, the number of scientists, and the cost of doing science (ie. the machinery, admin costs etc. has risen disproportionately and for the scientist working in today‚Äôs system, funds might seem more scarce than for a scientist of 50 years ago.**

One primary question for funding agencies is whether allocating large grants to a select few researchers is more impactful than providing smaller grants to a wider range of scientists. This debate is rooted in the notion that Big Science demands Big Funding‚Äîon the assumption that large investments in elite researchers yield proportionally larger discoveries. However, findings from an analysis of university-based researchers funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) challenge this assumption. A study by [Fortin & Currie, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fortin-Currie-2013-285e62198f3042a8aa1929d856925d1d) showed that while scientific output (measured by metrics such as publication count and citation rates) does increase with funding, the relationship is weak and exhibits diminishing returns: larger grants do not consistently lead to significantly greater impact. In fact, researchers receiving additional funding from a second federal source, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, did not produce substantially more impactful work than those funded solely by NSERC. This suggests that Big Funding may not be as effective as widely assumed, particularly when it comes to maximizing impact per dollar.

The exponential growth in the number of scientists has also qualitatively changed the nature of scientific pursuit. The intense competition in Big Science can stifle creativity, as researchers may feel pressured to pursue "hot topics" rather than novel ideas. This competitive environment often leaves emerging scientists with limited resources, struggling to establish their careers and gain access to funding. Historically, in the era of Small Science, a fewer number of scientists were competing for positions. Today, however, the sheer volume of scientists and research output has raised the bar significantly, making it challenging for many to sustain impactful, independent research and careers.

In summary, as science has shifted from a collaborative, small-scale endeavor to a vast and competitive enterprise, it has led to a reassessment of how resources are allocated. Evidence increasingly suggests that a balanced approach, favoring diversity over exclusivity, may be more productive and sustainable. Embracing elements of Small Science within the Big Science framework could help science maintain both its creativity and its impact in an era of unprecedented growth and complexity.
