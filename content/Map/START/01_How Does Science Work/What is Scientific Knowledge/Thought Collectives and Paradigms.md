**Abstract/Summary**

The works of Ludwig Fleck and subsequently Thomas Kuhn are probably the most influential inspirations for the field of science and technology studies.

In his book _Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact,_ Ludwig Fleck is the first one to recognize the social aspect of scientific knowledge production. he introduces the terms "Denkstil" (thought style) and "Denkkollektiv" (thought collective) to show that scientific knowledge is shaped by social contexts and prevailing ways of seeing the world. In line with this work - and without properly crediting it -, Thomas Kuhn introduces the notion of scientific ‚ÄúParadigms‚Äù: ‚Äúthe successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science. It is n‚Äù ([Kuhn, 2012 [1962]](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Kuhn-2012-1962-f035872861c74fc7a2f1125e3b859464?pvs=21), p. 43). Once a paradigm is dominant in a scientific community, every newly uncovered fact is viewed through the lens of said paradigm (normal science). Findings, that go against the established paradigm, are first termed as anomalies, then lead to a crisis in the community, giving way to search fo a new paradigm (revolutionary science) followed by growing consensus and finallly adoption of a new paradigm. For instance, the switch from Newtonian Optics to Quantum Mechanics in Physics can be treated as a case of paradigm shift. According to Kuhn, paradigms presuppose incommensurability, in other words two paradigms cannot exist along each other.

Importantly, Kuhn states that there is no scientific discovery outside of paradigms, hence the notion of scientific facts which ‚Äúreveal‚Äù themselves through experimentation or observation of nature, is not a process that happens in real life: ‚Äúonce it [a scientific theory] has achieved the status of paradigm, a scientific theory is declared invalid only if an alternate candidate is available to take its place. No process yet disclosed by the historical study of scientific development at all resembles the methodological stereotype of falsification by direct comparison with nature‚Äù ([Kuhn, 2012 [1962]](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Kuhn-2012-1962-f035872861c74fc7a2f1125e3b859464?pvs=21), p.90)
