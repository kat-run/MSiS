**Abstract/Summary (Perplexity AI)**

Thomas Gieryn's concept of "boundary-work" refers to the rhetorical strategies used by scientists to demarcate science from non-science for various purposes[1][2][3]. Key aspects of boundary-work include:

**Defining the Boundaries of Science**

Boundary-work involves attributing selected characteristics to science (its practitioners, methods, knowledge, values, etc.) to construct a boundary distinguishing it from non-scientific activities[1][2].

Scientists engage in boundary-work to expand their authority, exclude rivals, protect autonomy, and demarcate between disciplines[1][2].

**Flexibility of Boundaries**

The boundaries of science are ambiguous and contested, as the characteristics attributed to science are sometimes inconsistent[1].

Boundaries result from pursuing separate professional goals requiring different boundary constructions[1].

**Rhetorical Strategies**

Boundary-work is a rhetorical style used by scientists in "public science" to describe science for the public and political authorities[4].

It is used to create a favorable public image of science by contrasting it to non-scientific activities[4].

**Implications**

Boundary-work highlights that science is a flexible cultural space reshaped to claim credibility for some beliefs while denying it to others[3].

The problem of demarcating science from non-science is a practical issue for scientists, not just an analytic problem for philosophers and sociologists[4].

In summary, Gieryn's concept illuminates how the boundaries of science are socially constructed through rhetorical strategies employed by scientists to advance their interests and authority. The flexibility of these boundaries reflects the varied goals and contexts in which boundary-work occurs.
