**Abstract/Summary**

Lorraine Daston's theory of objectivity, particularly as articulated in her collaborative work with Peter Galison in the book _Objectivity_ (2007), explores the historical evolution of the concept of objectivity in scientific practice. Here are the key elements of her theory:

**Historical Context of Objectivity**

**Evolving Definitions**: Daston and Galison trace how the meaning of "objectivity" has changed over time, highlighting that it is not a static concept but one that has been shaped by cultural and historical contexts. They identify different "modes" of objectivity, each reflecting specific epistemic virtues and practices.

**Three Modes of Objectivity**:

- **Truth-to-Nature**: This early mode involved idealizing representations of nature, where artists and scientists aimed to depict the essence of objects, often through stylization and abstraction.
- **Mechanical Objectivity**: Emerging in the 19th century, this mode sought to minimize human intervention in the representation of nature, emphasizing the use of mechanical devices (like cameras) to capture images as accurately as possible. This approach aimed to produce knowledge that was free from subjective bias.
- **Trained Judgment**: This mode acknowledges the role of human expertise and experience in interpreting data and observations, recognizing that some degree of subjectivity is inherent in scientific practice.

**Rhetorical and Ethical Dimensions**

**Boundary Work**: Daston discusses how scientists engage in "boundary work" to differentiate scientific knowledge from non-scientific claims. This involves establishing criteria for what constitutes valid scientific knowledge and often requires a moral dimension, as scientists seek to uphold standards of integrity and rigor.

**Collective Knowledge Production**: Daston emphasizes that objectivity is not solely an individual pursuit but a collective endeavor. The act of seeing and knowing is embedded within specific scientific communities, where shared practices and norms shape what is considered objective.

**Moral and Epistemic Virtues**: The pursuit of objectivity involves not just technical skills but also moral commitments to transparency, accountability, and the ethical implications of scientific knowledge. Daston argues that these virtues are essential for maintaining the credibility and authority of science.

**Implications for Scientific Practice**

Daston's theory of objectivity challenges the notion that science can be completely free from subjectivity. Instead, she highlights the dynamic interplay between objectivity and subjectivity, suggesting that understanding scientific knowledge requires recognizing the historical, social, and ethical contexts in which it is produced. This perspective has significant implications for how we evaluate scientific claims and the role of scientists in society.
