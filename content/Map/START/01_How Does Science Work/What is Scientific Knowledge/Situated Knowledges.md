**Abstract/Summary**

(text taken from Ledgend)

The concept of **Situated Knowledges** was developed as a response to the need for a new approach to understanding and addressing the realities and objectivities of our world, particularly within the context of "the belly of the monster"‚Äîthe United States in the late 1980s ([Haraway, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haraway-1988-bc4549584d3f4daa8117480681e655b8?pvs=21), p. 581). Donna Haraway, along with other feminist scholars such as Sandra [Harding, 1986](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Harding-1986-8ee8b4014e0044b78f31049e1f329152?pvs=21), recognized that the traditional conceptualization of scientific knowledge is trapped in a fundamental dilemma. Early research in Science and Technology Studies (STS) has demonstrated that knowledge and scientific 'facts' are not simply uncovered or discovered; rather, they are constructed through a social process ([Latour, 1987](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Latour-1987-da8a1206342844669b30bf87a3ac0267?pvs=21)). This construction is often influenced by specific perspectives that have historically shaped science‚Äînamely, those that are western, male, and white. However, these perspectives conceal their origins behind what Haraway refers to as the "god trick" (Haraway, 1988, p. 581), meaning the puorported ‚Äòobjectivity‚Äô of scientific knowledge.

However, reducing the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of reality solely to a power struggle or a desire to separate sciences from the non-scientific world is only of limited utility for living in a knowledge society and finding truths about the world. Therefore, Haraway criticizes approaches like the Strong Program ([Bloor, 1991](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bloor-1991-0f5fa5ce0df14433b3aba222b65ba3b9?pvs=21) [1976]) and the concept of Boundary Work ([Gieryn, 1983](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gieryn-1983-7b14f244c0a046a2aa8046e139fd20d0?pvs=21)) because, while they highlight flaws in the established scientific system, they fail to provide a pathway out of the dilemma. This dilemma involves acknowledging the social processes and power dynamics inherent in scientific knowledge while still being able to "get to know the world effectively by practicing the sciences" ([Haraway, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haraway-1988-bc4549584d3f4daa8117480681e655b8?pvs=21) p. 577), a necessity in our current technoscientific world.

This issue is particularly pressing for those who are already marginalized: ‚ÄúIt has seemed to me that feminists have both selectively and flexibly used and been trapped by two poles of a tempting dichotomy on the question of objectivity‚Äù ([Haraway, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haraway-1988-bc4549584d3f4daa8117480681e655b8?pvs=21), p. 576). Haraway resolves this dilemma by advocating for a different standpoint: Situated Knowledges. By perceiving the world from a partial perspective and situating one‚Äôs knowledge in a specific context, it allows us to retain a claim to reality without resorting to the god trick of asserting superior and impartial knowledge: ‚ÄúWe need the power of modern critical theories of how meanings and bodies get made, not in order to deny meanings and bodies, but in order to build meanings and bodies that have a chance for life‚Äù (([Haraway, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haraway-1988-bc4549584d3f4daa8117480681e655b8?pvs=21), p. 580).

In this spirit of constructing new knowledge from a distinct vantage point, claims about the world and the pursuit of knowledge gain value only when the standpoint from which they are made is considered. This perspective intrinsically links the subject and object of research, thereby increasing the researcher‚Äôs responsibility for their work: **‚ÄúFeminist objectivity is about limited location and situated knowledge, not about transcendence and splitting of subject and object. It allows us to become answerable for what we learn how to see‚Äù** (([Haraway, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haraway-1988-bc4549584d3f4daa8117480681e655b8?pvs=21), p. 583). In this redefined notion of objectivity, accountability becomes paramount. As researchers, whether in sociology or biomedicine, we bear responsibility for the objects of our study. Our specific vantage points connect us to these objects, urging us to extend greater care and reflection toward them. This approach may also prompt us to recognize broader connections and implications in our research.
