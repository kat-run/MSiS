**Abstract/Summary**

> ‚ÄúI shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience. These considerations suggest that not the verifiability but the falsifiability of a system is to be taken as a criterion of demarcation.\*3 In other words: I shall not require of a scientific system that it shall be capable of being singled out, once and for all, in a positive sense; but I shall require that its logical form shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience.‚Äù ([Popper, 2002 [1934]](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Popper-2002-1934-797a6229e0064004b8d38c256b388e98?pvs=21) p. 18)

  

**(Perplexity AI)**

Falsifiability, introduced by philosopher Karl Popper, is a criterion for determining the scientific validity of theories and hypotheses. It asserts that for a theory to be considered scientific, it must be testable and capable of being proven false through empirical observation. Here are the key aspects of falsifiability:

### Definition

- **Falsifiability** (or **refutability**) is the principle that a theory or hypothesis is scientific only if it can, in principle, be shown to be false. This means there must be a possible observation or experiment that could contradict the theory[1][2][5].

### Importance in Science

- Falsifiability serves as a demarcation criterion, distinguishing scientific theories from non-scientific ones. For example, a hypothesis claiming that "all swans are white" can be falsified by the observation of a single black swan. Conversely, a claim that cannot be tested or potentially disproven, such as the existence of a deity with specific characteristics, is not considered scientific[2][3].

### Implications

- Popper argued that scientific theories are never definitively confirmed; they can only be corroborated until they are potentially falsified by new evidence. This approach emphasizes the provisional nature of scientific knowledge and the importance of rigorous testing[1][5].

### Examples

- **Scientific Example**: Einstein's theory of relativity is considered falsifiable because it makes specific predictions that can be tested through experiments. If future observations were to contradict these predictions, the theory could be deemed false[2].
- **Non-Scientific Example**: A theory that posits the existence of invisible, undetectable beings governing the universe is not falsifiable since there is no possible observation that could refute it[2].

### Conclusion

Falsifiability is a foundational concept in the philosophy of science, promoting the idea that scientific inquiry should be based on hypotheses that can be rigorously tested and potentially disproven. This principle encourages a dynamic understanding of scientific theories, where knowledge is continually refined through empirical investigation.
