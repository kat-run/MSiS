**Abstract/Summary**

From Bacon (_experimentum crucis)_ to Popper to Leviathan and the Airpump and gravitational waves:

Bacon: _Experimentum crucis_ is an experiment, which can determine decisively if a hypothesis is true or false

Popper: Falsifiability as the basis of scientific knowledge

Shapin and Schaffer: Experimentation as a social process → Who has credibility?

Collins ion the detection of gravitational waves:

> “A single negative experiment or observation could not prove the theory false, so Popper’s idea was itself flawed” (Collins, 2009, p. 30) (pdf)
