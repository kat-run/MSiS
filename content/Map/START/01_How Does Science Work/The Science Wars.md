**Abstract/Summary**

> ‚ÄúThis type of analysis ‚Äî in which it is shown that science cannot avoid human influence ‚Äî came to be called social constructivism and remained a little-known speciality until the early 1990s. Then some scientists began a war with the social constructivists, throwing them into the spotlight. Suddenly, sociologists were being blamed for the growing troubles of science, from the rejection of confidence in genetically modified foods to the diminution of funding. [‚Ä¶] It was said that sociologists were trying to undermine science. But we were not questioning the results of the great experiments, merely examining how the consensus about their interpretation was established. The conclusions of most of us were moderate: science could not deliver the absolute certainties of religion or morality, and scientists were not priests but rather skilful artisans, reaching towards universal truths but inevitably falling short. Far from being anti-science, we were trying to safeguard science against the danger of claiming more than it could deliver. If science presents itself as revealed truth it will inevitably disappoint, inviting a dangerous reaction; even the most talented craftsmen have their off-days, whereas a god must never fail.‚Äù ([Collins, 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Collins-2009-bfe2475dcf1d44d38af0a1c88cd810a3?pvs=21), p. 30f)

**What are the science wars? (perplexity AI)**

The science wars were a prominent series of debates during the 1990s that revolved around the nature of scientific knowledge and its societal implications. These discussions primarily emerged from the clash between traditional scientific perspectives and postmodern critiques, particularly those questioning the objectivity and authority of science.

**Background**

The term "science wars" gained traction following the publication of a controversial article by physicist Alan Sokal in the journal _Social Text_ in 1996. Sokal's article, which was intentionally nonsensical, aimed to expose what he perceived as the lack of rigor in certain postmodern academic circles. This incident sparked significant backlash and debate, positioning Sokal as a key figure in the defense of scientific rationalism against what he and others viewed as the encroachment of relativism and anti-science sentiments in academia[1][3].

**Key Themes and Arguments**

The science wars encapsulated a broader conflict over the legitimacy and interpretation of scientific knowledge. Critics of science, particularly from the humanities and social sciences, argued that scientific claims were often socially constructed and influenced by cultural and ideological factors. They contended that science was not merely a neutral pursuit of truth but rather a system of knowledge that could perpetuate power dynamics, including sexism and racism[2][4].

Defenders of science, on the other hand, emphasized the empirical foundations of scientific inquiry and the importance of objectivity. They argued that the critiques from postmodernists undermined the credibility of scientific knowledge and could lead to dangerous consequences, such as the legitimization of pseudoscience and the erosion of public trust in scientific institutions[1][2].

**Notable Events and Publications**

Several significant events and publications emerged from the science wars. The "Science and Its Critics" conference in 1997 brought together scientists and scholars to discuss these contentious issues, although it did not resolve the fundamental disagreements. Key publications included _Fashionable Nonsense_ by Sokal and Jean Bricmont, which criticized the misuse of scientific concepts in postmodern discourse, and _The One Culture?: A Conversation about Science_, which featured contributions from both scientists and social scientists aiming to bridge the divide[1][3].

The debates also extended beyond academia, influencing public perceptions of science. For instance, the rise of creation science as a counter to evolutionary theory highlighted the broader cultural tensions surrounding scientific authority and knowledge claims. Court rulings consistently rejected the notion that creation science could be equated with legitimate scientific inquiry, illustrating the ongoing struggle to define the boundaries of science in public discourse[2][4].

**Conclusion**

The science wars represented a critical moment in the relationship between science and society, highlighting the tensions between differing epistemological frameworks. While the debates were often contentious, they also fostered a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in the production and interpretation of scientific knowledge. The legacy of the science wars continues to influence discussions about science, knowledge, and their roles in contemporary society.
