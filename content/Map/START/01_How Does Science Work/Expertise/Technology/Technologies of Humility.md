**Abstract/Summary (Perplexity AI)**

Sheila Jasanoff's concept of "technologies of humility" emphasizes the need for a more reflective and inclusive approach to governance, particularly in the context of science and technology. This framework advocates for recognizing the limitations of scientific knowledge and the complexity of societal issues, thereby promoting a more democratic and participatory decision-making process.

**Key Concepts**

_Definition_

Technologies of humility are methods that encourage policymakers to engage with uncertainty and complexity in technological governance. They emphasize the importance of understanding the ethical dimensions of technological decisions and fostering public participation in these processes. Jasanoff argues that traditional approaches often overlook the unpredictable nature of technological systems, leading to failures and disasters.

_Four Focal Points_

Jasanoff identifies four critical areas to guide the development of technologies of humility:

**Framing**: The way issues are presented significantly affects policy outcomes. A narrow framing can lead to ineffective solutions.

**Vulnerability**: Recognizing who is at risk from technological interventions is essential for equitable decision-making.

**Distribution**: Understanding how risks and benefits are distributed among different societal groups helps address inequalities.

**Learning**: Encouraging a culture of continuous learning and adaptation in response to new information and unforeseen consequences is crucial[2][3][4].

**Examples**

_Technologies of Humility_

**Public Engagement Initiatives**: Programs that involve citizens in discussions about local environmental policies, allowing diverse perspectives to shape decision-making.

**Participatory Risk Assessment**: Engaging communities in assessing risks associated with industrial projects, ensuring that local knowledge and concerns are integrated into regulatory processes.

**Adaptive Management Practices**: Approaches in environmental management that allow for adjustments based on ongoing learning and feedback from stakeholders[2][3][4].

_Technologies of Hubris_

**Nuclear Power Plants**: The belief that advanced engineering can entirely eliminate risks associated with nuclear energy, disregarding potential catastrophic failures.

**Artificial Intelligence Systems**: The assumption that AI can make unbiased decisions without acknowledging the inherent biases in data or the ethical implications of such decisions.

**Genetic Engineering**: The confidence in controlling biological systems through genetic modification without fully understanding ecological impacts or long-term consequences[2][3][4].

In summary, Jasanoff's technologies of humility advocate for a more cautious, inclusive, and ethically aware approach to technology governance, contrasting sharply with technologies of hubris, which embody overconfidence in human control over complex systems.
