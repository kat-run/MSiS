**Abstract/Summary (Perplexity AI)**

In his book "Impure Science: AIDS, Activism, and the Politics of Knowledge," sociologist Steven Epstein examines how the AIDS movement has transformed biomedical research practices through its capacity to gain credibility using novel strategies. Epstein argues that in the turbulent history of AIDS research and treatment, the boundaries between scientist insiders and lay outsiders have been crossed to an unprecedented degree in medical history.

Key points from the book:

- Epstein focuses on how certainty about AIDS is constructed or deconstructed through the views of medical researchers, activists, policymakers, and others. He shows how knowledge about AIDS emerges from "credibility struggles."[1][5]
- **AIDS research has been a highly social and political phenomenon. Non-scientist AIDS activists have gained a significant voice in the scientific world, shaping NIH-sponsored research to a remarkable extent.[1][5]**
- **Due to the blurring of roles and responsibilities, the production of biomedical knowledge about AIDS does not follow the typical pathways of science. AIDS research is unusually broad, public, and contested**.[1][5]
- Epstein concludes by analyzing recent efforts to democratize biomedicine. While AIDS activists have paved the way for challenging scientific authority, all social movements seeking to democratize expertise face significant difficulties.[1][5]

Overall, "Impure Science" provides a comprehensive account of the AIDS epidemic, useful for activists, policymakers, and the general public, as well as sociologists, physicians, and scientists. It highlights the transformative impact of the AIDS movement on biomedical research practices.
