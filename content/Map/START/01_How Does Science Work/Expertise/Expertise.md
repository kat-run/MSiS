**Abstract/Summary**

Expertise is not just an important tool for political decision making ( see [[Scientific Expertise in policy making]]), it can also be defined as a property of science. Expertise is characterized not just by collecting knowledge on a certain topic, but also includes other, more [[Non-Discursive aspects of Science]], like tacit knowledge ([Collins, 1994](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Collins-1994-9f631ec5222c4cdb94627724d03f4633?pvs=21)), a certain feel for trends and a certain element of networking and community-resources. Gaining expertise on a topic is one of the hallmarks of most science careers. Especially in today‚Äôs specialized science ecosystem, expertise in a certain topic is also seen as one of the most important credentials for a scientist within the science system and without: _‚Äú_the dominant view serves scientists (and others who derive their authority from technical expertise) as a resource in public discourse, providing a repertoire of rhetorical devices for interpreting science for outsiders, and a powerful tool for sustaining the social hierarchy of expertise_‚Äù (__[Hilgartner, 1990](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Hilgartner-1990-eca5a736eb13469b99438fee92a79e60?pvs=21)__, p. 519)._ Hence, who is recognized as an expert (of any topic, not just in the sciences) is valued more highly in social, than thiose without expertise.

In the early 80, up until now, the social studies of science have questioned this prominent space of scientific expertise in the social discourse and have shown the importance of considering so-called ‚Äòlay-experts‚Äô and affected groups in sociotechnical crises (see for instance [[Impure Science- AIDS, Activism, and the Politics of Knowledge]] and [[‚ÄúLay-Experts‚Äù - Sheep Farmers and the public uptake of science]]). Recently in the wake of the disinformation age and global crises, scholars have been arguing for a re-examination of this overly critical notion of expertise: ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòProblem of Legitimacy‚Äô has been replaced by the ‚ÄòProblem of Extension' - that is, by a tendency to dissolve the boundary between experts and the public so that there are no longer any grounds for limiting the indefinite extension of technical decision-making rights. ‚Äú [Collins & Evans, 2002](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Collins-Evans-2002-11a8721018668142a12dfa17bdd01cf7?pvs=21), p. 235. In ‚Äòthe Death of expertise‚Äô ([Nichols, 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Nichols-2024-2163faf0e68642bdbf66be799693a0db?pvs=21)), Tom Nichols examines reasons for the increasingly blurred boundaries and the -sometimes severs- consequences for our democracy in the context of the contemporary United States is Collins and Evans argue for a more differential and situational evaluation of expertise, that gives credence to the experts in a certain topic, but that also gives space to less institutionalized forms of expertise, like lived experience, which not necessarily need to be able to be justified by scientific means ([Collins & Evans, 2007](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Collins-Evans-2007-96ae6459d3ec4cc69766ab70507ba568?pvs=21)).

I have argued that, expertise not only has an important role in our modern society, the concept also has many facets. In the sub-nodes, i try to depict this diversity.
