**Abstract/Summary (Perplexity)**

Collins and Evans define the "third wave" of science studies as a shift towards the study of expertise and experience, emphasizing the importance of understanding how knowledge is produced and utilized in various contexts. This wave builds on previous waves of science studies, which focused on the social construction of scientific knowledge and the role of science in society.

### Key Aspects of the Third Wave

1. **Focus on Expertise**: The third wave highlights the significance of expertise in decision-making processes. It examines how different forms of expertise, including lay and professional knowledge, interact and influence public policy and societal issues.
2. **Experiential Knowledge**: Collins and Evans argue that personal experiences and the context in which knowledge is applied are crucial for understanding the dynamics of expertise. This approach recognizes that knowledge is not just about abstract theories but is deeply rooted in lived experiences.
3. **Problem of Extension**: The authors address the "Problem of Extension," which refers to the challenges in applying scientific knowledge to real-world situations. They advocate for a more nuanced understanding of how scientific knowledge can be extended beyond the laboratory to address complex societal problems.
4. **Normative Theory of Expertise**: The third wave proposes a normative framework that considers not only the technical aspects of expertise but also its ethical implications and social responsibilities. This perspective encourages a more democratic engagement with science, where diverse voices and forms of knowledge are recognized and valued.

In summary, the third wave of science studies, as articulated by Collins and Evans, represents a critical evolution in understanding how expertise and experience shape knowledge production and its application in societal contexts, advocating for a more inclusive and reflective approach to science and technology.
