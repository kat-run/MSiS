In his 1973 book ‚ÄúThe sociology of science: theoretical and empirical investigations‚Äù, based on a 1942 essay, Robert K. Merton outlined four defining characteristics that distinguish scientific knowledge from other types of knowledge, emphasizing the unique social and epistemological foundations of scientific knowledge and, importantly, that they are enforced through a system of social control. The four norms are universalism, communism, disinterestedness and organized skepticism (CUDOS).

1. **Universalism**: Scientific knowledge is based on universal criteria and is not influenced by the personal attributes of individuals. The validity of scientific claims is evaluated through objective and impersonal criteria, such as empirical evidence and logical consistency, regardless of who presents them.
2. **Communism (Communalism)**: Scientific knowledge is considered a public good that must be shared openly. This means that scientific findings are shared with the community, allowing for collective verification, critique, and further development. This open sharing is in contrast to proprietary knowledge or trade secrets.
3. **Disinterestedness**: Scientists are expected to act for the benefit of the scientific enterprise rather than for personal gain. This norm implies that the pursuit of knowledge should be free from biases and conflicts of interest, ensuring that research is conducted with integrity and impartiality.
4. **Organized Skepticism**: Scientific claims are subject to rigorous scrutiny and skepticism. This critical attitude is essential for the advancement of science, as it ensures that only well-substantiated knowledge is accepted. Organized skepticism involves a systematic and structured approach to questioning and testing scientific claims.

These norms, collectively known as Mertonian norms, underscore the distinctive features of scientific knowledge. They highlight the systematic, communal, and empirical nature of science, setting it apart from other forms of knowledge production and validation.

  

**Are these norms prevalent in the current Science System?**

The formulation of these norms sparked a great amount of controversies in the field of Philosophy and Sociology of Science.

Already in the 70s, the set of norms was tested on their basis in day-to-day Science. By studying the Apollo moon missions, [Mitroff, 1974](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mitroff-1974-16934a58fed749de8b054e55f5784840?pvs=21) formulated counternorms that he described as equally present in the science system. Those counternorms, solitariness, particularism, interest, and organized dogmatism, he argues, are present in an equal manner than the norms originally formulated by Merton. Merton himself, in later works denied, the claim to exclusivity and argued that multiple normative systems are at work in any institution and consequently also in the current science system.

The very idea of norms and counternorms has been questioned by Michael [Mulkay, 1976](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mulkay-1976-c3966681d84f49a8859a804aeedf4cab?pvs=21). He questions the usefulness of norms to classify how scientists behave in real life and proposes to use the notion of Ideology when talking about the guiding principles and : ‚Äúwhat have previously been regarded as components of the dominant normative structure of science are better conceived as vocabularies of justification, which are used to evaluate, justify and describe the professional actions of scientists, but which are not institutionalized within the scientific community in such a way that general conformity is maintained‚Äù ([Mulkay, 1976](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mulkay-1976-c3966681d84f49a8859a804aeedf4cab?pvs=21), p. 653f). Hence, any talk about scientific norms is used by scientists mainly for outsiders to describe the ‚Äúsocial stereotype‚Äù ([Mulkay, 1976](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mulkay-1976-c3966681d84f49a8859a804aeedf4cab?pvs=21), p. 647) for competing for their interests, in other work can be considered [[Boundary Work]]. However, despite these analyses, scholars also underlined the importance of these particular norms in the current epistemic system: ‚ÄúFor decades the consensus among social scientists has been that, as descriptions of the norms that actually guide scientists‚Äô action, Merton‚Äôs norms do not exist in any pervasive form. . . **. It is possible to salvage Merton‚Äôs delineation of the norms of science, but only as a prescription of how scientists should behave ideally**‚Äù ([Hess, 1997](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Hess-1997-ca35ecf3c7e94f4db53570d4113ae81e?pvs=21), p. 57).

[Anderson et al., 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Anderson-et-al-2010-8f18deac2a5749f9a1c48227e2aa9664?pvs=21) asked scientists if they still held onto the Mertonian norms in their day-to day- life, found that the narrow set of guidelines is inadequate to describe how science ought to be done in the current system: ‚Äúthe Mertonian norms offered too spare a characterization of the scientific normative system or of any individual‚Äôs normative orientation.‚Äù ([Anderson et al., 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Anderson-et-al-2010-8f18deac2a5749f9a1c48227e2aa9664?pvs=21), p. 367). They argue that most of the norms of science are non-descriptive and therefore can hardly be challenged: ‚Äúmuch of the normative system of science is latent. Most expectations and assumptions about appropriate and desirable behavior are thoroughly embedded in the culture(s) of science and remain unknown because they are never challenged.‚Äù ([Anderson et al., 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Anderson-et-al-2010-8f18deac2a5749f9a1c48227e2aa9664?pvs=21), p. 390).

On the question of whether any norms are relevant to the current scientific system, they take a very nuanced stand insofar as they acknowledge their inadequacy while still showing that they somehow are shaping the current science system: ‚ÄúThe Mertonian norms, as principles representative of the normative system of science, have been challenged, attacked, dismissed, contested, inconsistently referenced, and, in short, battered and bruised by controversy and careless application. They nonetheless have endured for over 65 years as part of the communal property of science. [‚Ä¶] No self-interested scholar has ever gotten rich doing analyses of the norms, and, as the literature demonstrates, they have been clarified and improved because of the scientific community‚Äôs eloquent, organized skepticism‚Äù ([Anderson et al., 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Anderson-et-al-2010-8f18deac2a5749f9a1c48227e2aa9664?pvs=21), p. 391).
