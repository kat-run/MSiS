**Abstract/Summary (perplexity AI)**

Mode 2 science, conceptualized in the influential book _The New Production of Knowledge_ by Michael Gibbons and colleagues in 1994, represents a shift in the way scientific knowledge is produced, particularly in response to societal needs and technological advancements. Here are the key characteristics and implications of Mode 2 science:

**Characteristics of Mode 2 Science**

**Context-Driven**: Unlike Mode 1, which is primarily academic and discipline-focused, Mode 2 emphasizes knowledge production in real-world contexts. It is driven by practical applications and societal challenges rather than purely theoretical pursuits[2].

**Transdisciplinary Approach**: Mode 2 encourages collaboration across various disciplines. Multidisciplinary teams work together for short periods to address specific problems, integrating diverse perspectives and expertise[1][2].

**Heterogeneity and Organizational Diversity**: This mode recognizes that knowledge production occurs in varied organizational settings, not just traditional academic institutions. It includes contributions from industry, government, and civil society, reflecting a broader array of stakeholders in the research process[2].

**Social Accountability and Reflexivity**: Mode 2 science stresses the importance of being socially accountable. Researchers are expected to engage with the public and consider the societal implications of their work, fostering a reflexive approach to knowledge production[1][2].

**Quality Control**: The criteria for assessing quality in Mode 2 are more diverse and context-dependent compared to the traditional metrics used in Mode 1. This adaptability reflects the complexities of knowledge application in various fields[2].

**Implications of Mode 2 Science**

**Shift in Research Funding**: The emergence of Mode 2 has influenced how research funding is allocated, prioritizing projects that demonstrate real-world applicability and societal relevance[2].

**Blurring of Boundaries**: The distinctions between basic and applied research become less clear, as Mode 2 encourages a more integrated approach to knowledge that transcends traditional academic boundaries[2].

**Evolving Role of Scientists**: Scientists in Mode 2 are not just independent researchers; they are part of collaborative networks that include various stakeholders. This change necessitates new skills, such as communication and negotiation, to effectively engage with diverse audiences[2].

Overall, Mode 2 science reflects a significant transformation in the landscape of knowledge production, highlighting the need for research to be responsive to societal needs and emphasizing collaboration across disciplines and sectors.
