**Abstract/Summary**

**Summary (Perplexity AI)**

Post-normal science (PNS) is a conceptual framework developed in the 1990s by Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome Ravetz. It addresses complex, policy-relevant issues characterized by high uncertainty, disputed values, significant stakes, and urgent decision-making needs. This framework emerges as a response to situations where traditional scientific methods fall short due to the complexities and uncertainties inherent in real-world problems.

## Key Features of Post-Normal Science

1. **Uncertainty**: PNS acknowledges that many scientific issues involve significant uncertainties, making it difficult to rely solely on established scientific facts. For example, climate change and public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic exemplify scenarios where facts are uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable[1][3].
2. **Value Disputes**: In post-normal contexts, values play a critical role in shaping decisions. Different stakeholders may have conflicting interests and ethical considerations that influence how problems are framed and solutions proposed[2][4].
3. **High Stakes**: The implications of decisions made in post-normal science scenarios can be profound, affecting large populations and ecosystems. This urgency necessitates a departure from traditional scientific ideals that prioritize objectivity and neutrality[1][3].
4. **Extended Peer Communities**: PNS promotes the involvement of a broader range of stakeholders in the scientific process, including non-experts who can provide valuable insights into societal values and concerns. This shift aims to enhance the quality of decision-making processes by incorporating diverse perspectives[2][4].

## Comparison with Traditional Science

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Aspect|Traditional Science|Post-Normal Science|
|**Nature of Problems**|Well-defined, low uncertainty|Complex, high uncertainty|
|**Decision Stakes**|Low stakes|High stakes|
|**Role of Values**|Values considered secondary|Values central to decision-making|
|**Stakeholder Involvement**|Limited to experts|Inclusive of broader communities|

## Applications of Post-Normal Science

PNS is particularly relevant in fields such as environmental policy, public health, and technology regulation. It encourages scientists to engage with societal challenges that require not just technical solutions but also ethical considerations and public participation. Examples include:

- **Climate Change Mitigation**: Decisions about which areas to protect from rising sea levels involve complex trade-offs between economic interests and environmental sustainability[1][3].
- **Public Health Policies**: The response to pandemics requires balancing health measures against social freedoms and economic impacts[1][2].

## Conclusion

Post-normal science represents a paradigm shift in how we understand the role of science in society. By recognizing the complexities of contemporary issues, it fosters a more inclusive approach to scientific inquiry that values diverse perspectives and ethical considerations alongside empirical data. This framework is essential for addressing the multifaceted challenges facing modern society, making it increasingly relevant as global problems become more intricate and interconnected[2][4].
