Such experiences are the rhythms of life, organic, emotional and mental (the rhythm of attention is an interesting link among them all), which are not simply periodic, but endlessly complex, and sensitive to every sort of influence. All together they compose the dynamic pattern of feeling* It is this pattern that only non-discursive symbolic forms can present, and that is the point and purpose of artistic construction.
