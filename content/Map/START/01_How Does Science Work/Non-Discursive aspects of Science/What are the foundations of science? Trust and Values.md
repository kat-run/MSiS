**Abstract/Summary**

In a series of essays, Henry Collins, an STS researcher who works in the field of expertise and the construction of scientific facts (his most famous study is on the detection of gravitational waves), he puts trust and values at the center of the science system, partially refuting past relativistic claims of STS about science and power: “The recent dominance of this second wave has unfortunately led some from science studies and the broader humanities movement known as postmodernism to conclude that science is just a form of faith or politics. They have become overly cynical about science. The prospect of a society that entirely rejects the values of science and expertise is too awful to contemplate” ([Collins, 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Collins-2009-bfe2475dcf1d44d38af0a1c88cd810a3?pvs=21), p. 30).

In order to counter this trend, as well as broader societal trends like science skepticism and conspiratorial ways of thinking, science has to “choose, or ‘elect’, to put the values that underpin scientific thinking back in the center of our world; we must replace postmodernism with ‘elective modernism’. To support this, social scientists must work out what is right about science, not just what is wrong — we cannot live by sKepticism alone. Natural scientists, too, have a part to play: they must reflect on and recognize the limits of their practice and their understanding. Together, we must choose to live in a society that recognizes the value of experience and expertise” ([Collins, 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Collins-2009-bfe2475dcf1d44d38af0a1c88cd810a3?pvs=21), p. 30). For Collins, trust is at the center of these values: “Science is the search for truth about the observable world. But it rests on values. The only thing that can be discovered by observation is the immediate here and now. Otherwise, knowledge about the observable world is based on hearsay, spoken or recorded, about others’ observations. Apart from small and fleeting observations, science rests on trust. Our scientific lives and scientific knowledge depend on choosing who and what to trust. Since we can meet only a few scientists at best, we have to decide whether to trust science as an institution. Science is a good bet because its aim is to create truth, perhaps posthumously; truth is its end as well as its means. In today's world, science is vitally important as a check and balance on democratic power and an object lesson for decision-makers. To do good, honest, science is to support democracy in the face of populism” ([Collins, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Collins-2023-c9c261c8c23349c89e8363bd552564a3?pvs=21), p. 264).
