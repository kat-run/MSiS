**Literature**

There is much scientific research by Think Thanks, but not much scientific research about them

**Abstract/Summary**

Think Tanks are organizations that produce knowledge, intended to be used for political decision making ([Gellner, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gellner-2013-6556a2c7a2a549b5bb931948bddc5c5b?pvs=21)). In other words, they provide research and policy advice about certain topics. There are a variety of specializations, affiliations and targets of think tanks and therefore a generalization about their objectives or purpose is impossible to make (which might also be the reason why so little systematic research is done about them). Most Think tanks are non-governmental, but there are also some that are affiliated to government-adjacent structures, like political parties, whereas some exist within the framework of governmental agencies but hold a semi-autonomous position. In general, they are more common in the anglo-saxon world, but have become more and more common globally ([McGann, 2002](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/McGann-2002-2cbcec9f375242ae82a99af54644dd70?pvs=21)).

Think Tanks serve a special role in the epistemic system and in our knowledge society. Firstly their goal is more clear cut than in most other academic institutions. They provide real-life (policy-) advice. Hence, the problems they look at are always with a practical goal in mind. Since researchers working in Think Tanks are not bound by some customs of the academic world, for instance teaching or the need to publish in scholarly journals (although there is also a niche for them in the academic publishing system), they can also do research in a different way than university scholars.

However, these ambiguities can also be exploited for purposes, other than policy advice. For instance,[ the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/think-tank-scholars-corporate-consultants.html) () revealed, that the business model of some think tanks, especially in the economic realm, has shifted from policy advice to selling networks and exploiting contacts for private companies: ‚ÄúAn examination of 75 think tanks found an array of researchers who had simultaneously worked as registered lobbyists, members of corporate boards or outside consultants in litigation and regulatory disputes, with only intermittent disclosure of their dual roles‚Äù ([Lipton et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Lipton-et-al-2016-d083d6532a3145508fbc0b9d53503c3c?pvs=21)). Hence, in the ecosystem of policy makers, advisers and interest groups, the role of a Think Tanker and the line between a lobbyist is increasingly blurred: ‚Äúwhen some institutions engage in influence peddling and advocacy all the time, and nearly all institutions do it some of the time, it makes it impossible for the ordinary citizen to separate out honest from dishonest think tanks. As a consequence, the policy community becomes one big swamp in which the influence-peddlers‚Äô schmutz dirties even the most erudite and independent policy intellectual‚Äù ([Shapiro, 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Shapiro-2024-814786dab7e34b44aba0083c7e88a12f?pvs=21)). [Roberts & King, 1991](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Roberts-King-1991-2391257113714c8bbed118200ede00cb?pvs=21), coin the term ‚Äòpolicy entrepreneur‚Äô for this type of advocacy: ‚Äúpolicy entrepreneurs advocate new ideas and develop proposals; define and reframe problems; specify policy alternatives; broker the ideas among the many policy actors; mobilize public opinion; help set the decision making agenda" ([Roberts & King, 1991](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Roberts-King-1991-2391257113714c8bbed118200ede00cb?pvs=21), p. 148). This description is fitting for most large contemporary Think Tanks.
