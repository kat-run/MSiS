**Abstract/Summary**

Ethics committees have become a fixed point of the epistemic system and have a key role in scientific governance. Especially in the biomedical sciences, ethical approval, often issued by independent committees, is nowadays a prerequisite for conducting research. Additionally, ethics committees devise institutions‚Äô guidelines for ethical conduct of their employees ([McGee et al., 2001](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/McGee-et-al-2001-713581cb5f254f68a0a21c00cb56c564?pvs=21)).

It is interesting to look deeper into the process of ethics reviews and its implications. While approval through an ethics committee is straightforward and warranted for some types of research, namely in the biomedical field, other types, like qualitative research, do not always fit the formalized procedure: ‚Äúthe ethics-review process is based on epistemological assumptions aligned with positivistic research, and does not fit the qualitative research process.‚Äù ([Tolich & Fitzgerald, 2006](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Tolich-Fitzgerald-2006-c96cced536674d1692ceda52295f2a7c?pvs=21) , p. 71). Also the composition of ethics committees has a substantial influence on the process of review, as well as on the efficiency of ethical approval [Guillemin et al., 2012](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Guillemin-et-al-2012-4621fa1226d44b418eef5d300c1d8567?pvs=21)). Finally, if ethical approval is very formalized and a prerequisite for any type of research, it runs the risk of becoming to formalized or being just a box-ticking exercise instead of leading to reflection: ‚ÄúA form seems attractive because it creates ‚Äútangible evidence‚Äù, in our case, proving that broader societal values have been considered. At the same time, it is a tool of standardization of what counts as the formal fulfillment of reflexive work and allows control.‚Äù ([Felt, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2016-36270d70e95f4705bc84d1e8a390b463?pvs=21), p. 62)

In this context, it is interesting to think about the purposes of such committees. At the first glance, their primary role is to protect the research object, meaning participants of a study or safeguard against potential unwanted implications. However, those committees can also work to protect their institution from potential damages, be it in legal terms or in terms of public relations ([Guillemin et al., 2012](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Guillemin-et-al-2012-4621fa1226d44b418eef5d300c1d8567?pvs=21)). Thirdly, committees are also strengthening the role of administrative personnel in an academic institution because it is mostly their task to oversee and organize the process. This in turn might give the managerial class more power over the research process.
