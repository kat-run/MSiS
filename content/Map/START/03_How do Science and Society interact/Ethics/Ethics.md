**Abstract/Summary**

The root of the word ethics is the greek ‚Äòethos‚Äô, meaning custom or behavior. Today‚Äôs meaning of ethical can be described as behaving in a certain, desired and agreed upon way. In science, the field of ethics is as important as it is vast. It reaches into every aspect of scientific life: into the content and the consequences of research (i.e. can we genetically modify human embryos?), into how scientists behave amongst each other (i.e. how do we attribute authorship), into how scientists behave outside of their disciplines (i.e. Who should hold intellectual property rights to a discovery?). In principle, ethics can be defined as a set of norms and principles, according to which scientific research should be carried out. This is also why most research institutions have a set of ethics guidelines or a code-of-conduct which makes the rules according to which the institution wants to work explicit (see for instance Eurac Ethics and Integrity principles in the attachment). In our current knowledge society, it is crucial for scientists and researchers to reflect on the ethical consequences and implication of the research they carry out: ‚Äúas research and technology are changing society and the way we live, scientists can no longer claim that science is neutral but must consider the ethical and social aspects of their work‚Äù [Iaccarino, 2001](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Iaccarino-2001-2bcf4c00251c4ad3b3ab71f851f630f7?pvs=21), p. 747). Especially in the 1990 amongst public crises surrounding the use of GMOs in agriculture or the BSE crisis, the public calls for science to justify their research agenda became salient ([Nelkin, 1995](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Nelkin-1995-5ac37c5ac2d1442f847c9c8b36895f62?pvs=21)).

Since then, especially in the life sciences, ethics has often been discussed in the context of scientific misconduct i.e if single scientists do not behave according to ethical standards (D‚ÄôAngelo, 2018). However, not following such standards can also have systemic components: ‚ÄúIf science‚Äôs research environment contributes to misconduct, then reports of misconduct reflect some structural problems in the research environment and cannot be treated as isolated incidents of pathological behavior.‚Äù (Resnik, 2005, p. 13). Therefore, it is important to see unethical behavior also as a failure of the system, not just of the single scientist. If the system rewards or overlooks unethical behavior, for instance if it favors ruthlessness and focuses on results while overlooking the processes, unethical behavior is not a failure of the system, but a feature of the system. An example for this is the controversy surrounding the biomedical researcher and entrepreneur **[He Jiankui](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/apr/01/crispr-cas9-he-jiankui-genome-gene-editing-babies-scientist-back-in-lab)**, who genetically engineered two human embryos so that they would not be immune against certain variants of HIV. After his research was made public on the video platform Youtube, the scientific community, as well as the Chinese state where he conducted his research, was quick to condemn the scientist and paint him as a rogue individual, who had violated the rules of the (ethical) game (see for instance [Krimsky, 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Krimsky-2019-45aceec9b36648089a1c2df5ab6b2312?pvs=21)). However, the wrongdoing of the ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù scientist hardly ever happens in a vacuum but ‚Äú‚Äòirresponsible‚Äô research was the result of various (dis)qualifications and demarcations‚Äù [Meyer, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Meyer-2022-44d296f37f3443f1b6643133f52008e5?pvs=21), p.

Importantly, ethical guidelines are not set in stone and often disputed and modified within the scientific community and beyond. They can also be different in different national contexts. For instance, the use of atomic energy is desired and seen as an ethical alternative to fossil fuels in countries like France and Finland, whereas countries like Austria and Germany refute this logic due to concerns surrounding the safety of this energy source (see for instance [Felt, 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2015-89b1ad29648d46faa948bf7b604a1ebb?pvs=21)). Therefore it is vital for science, as well as society to address issues at the ethical borderlands, as new research and technology emerges, and keep ethics under constant discourse and revision. How this can be achieved in our current democratic society is not straightforward. A balance between revering expertise of science and technology while still being attuned to the needs and concerns of a pluralistic society needs to be striked. Some possibilities to facilitate this discourse are provided by [Callon et al., 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Callon-et-al-2009-a6a49d891d984609bc722aadba159ebf?pvs=21).
