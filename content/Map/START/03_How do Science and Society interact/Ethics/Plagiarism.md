Plagiarism is a major problem for research. There are, however, divergent views on how to define plagiarism and on what makes plagiarism reprehensible. In this paper we explicate the concept of “plagiarism” and discuss plagiarism normatively in relation to research. We suggest that plagiarism should be understood as “someone using someone else’s intellectual product (such as texts, ideas, or results), thereby implying that it is their own” and argue that this is an adequate and fruitful definition. We discuss a number of circumstances that make plagiarism more or less grave and the plagiariser more or less blameworthy. As a result of our normative analysis, we suggest that what makes plagiarism reprehensible as such is that it distorts scientific credit. In addition, intentional plagiarism involves dishonesty. There are, furthermore, a number of potentially negative consequences of plagiarism.

  

**Public cases of Plagiarism -** _**Cui Bono?**_

Especially the german-speaking world, but increasingly also the anglo-saxon sphere, saw a number of public figures under scrutiny for plagiarism in their dissertations. One of the most prominent examples is the former German minister of Defense [Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/wissenschaftsplagiate/). Most recently the former president of Harvard University [Claudine Gay](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/jan/06/harvard-claudine-gay-plagiarism) resigned over accusations of plagiarism. While scrutiny over plagiarism often derived from investigative news-outlets - for instance the German magazine _der Spiegel_ uncovered the plagiarism case of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg-, especially in recent cases, the accusations of plagiarism were often issued with a political goal in mind. For instance, the plagiarism accusations, against Claudine Gay reveal a deeper agenda: “Investigations by the [Washington Free Beacon](https://freebeacon.com/campus/harvard-president-claudine-gay-hit-with-six-new-charges-of-plagiarism/) and the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/01/04/news/claudine-gay-plagiarism-scandal-questions-mount-for-harvard/), at least partially instigated by the conservative activist Christopher Rufo and his crusade to chase “wokeism” and diversity initiatives from all corners of society, turned up nearly 50 instances of alleged plagiarism in Gay’s academic writing. According to the Harvard board, a school subcommittee and independent panel charged with investigating the plagiarism allegations against Gay found “a few instances of inadequate citation” but “no violation of Harvard’s standard for research misconduct”; Gay was said to be “proactively requesting” four corrections.” ([Lawrence, 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Lawrence-2024-96f9c0f1a800428fba1fb8d74bd8a913?pvs=21)). In a similar line, the journalist [Alexandra Föderl Schmidt](https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000229971/foederl-schmid-kehrt-als-nachrichtenchefin-zur-sueddeutschen-zurueck) was accused of plagiarism in her dissertation and in her journalistic texts by a “[plagiarism hunter](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/umstrittener-plagiatsjaeger-stefan-weber-rache-eines-verfemten-a-b0426fb5-1dfb-4f12-8fe4-6887a583702c)”, who was hired by a far-right news portal. After an investigation by the University, the accusations turned out to be unsubstantiated and no relevant plagiarism was detected. However, the reputation and mental health of the journalist took a turn for the worse and she still has not fully recovered from the targeted campaign.

These two examples show that accusations of plagiarisms never happen in a vacuum. There might be actors who have ulterior motives than the integrity of scientific research. The cases also underline the importance of following good scientific practice and citation guidelines.
