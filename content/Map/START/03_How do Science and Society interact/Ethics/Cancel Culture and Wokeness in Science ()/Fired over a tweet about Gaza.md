Eisen is perhaps best known as a leader [in the movement](https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/michael-eisen-plos-open-access-aaron-swartz/) to transform science publishing. He’s also known for his outspokenness. That evening, frustrated by what he considered to be the “feckless” response of college and university administrators to the crisis, he reposted the _Onion_ link on his personal account, with commentary.

…

**Several Israeli scientists,** incensed by his post, were agitating to get him fired from _eLife_. They and others vowed to stop submitting papers to the journal—some said they were stepping down as article editors or reviewers. In tweets and emails, they accused Eisen of anti-Israeli bias, and worse.

…

Over the next few days, Eisen says, he spoke with the people at _eLife_, arguing that it was “ludicrous” to believe he harbored bias against Israeli scientists, with whom he works all the time, and that his problem was clearly with the Israeli government. 

**But he already had a “somewhat testy” relationship with the board. On his watch,** _**eLife**_ **had embraced a radical new publishing model called “publish-review-curate.” The journal would no longer make up-or-down decisions as to which papers to accept. Instead, it would publish them all, along with comments from the journal’s reviewers. Plenty of people were resistant to the new model (which** _**eLife**_ **says it will continue). Some “had it in for me, and they started piling on and being like, ‘Mike’s an embarrassment, he’s unprofessional,’” he says.**

The board summoned him in and asked him to explain himself. Then its members went into a private session. A few hours later, Eisen says, a board member called and told him the board was asking him to resign: “I said, ‘No, I can’t resign under these circumstances, because first, it’s a bad decision for _eLife_.’ Second, it would be an admission that this was a bad thing, and I don’t think it was.”

When he learned the board was securing his replacement, he announced his firing on X. The journal released a [statement](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/495baf34/statement-of-the-elife-board-of-directors) the same day thanking him for his service, and asserting that Eisen’s dismissal was based on past issues as well: “Mike has been given clear feedback from the board that his approach to leadership, communication and social media has at key times been detrimental to the cohesion of the community we are trying to build and hence to eLife’s mission. It is against this background that a further incidence of this behaviour has contributed to the board’s decision.”

  

**Question:**

Was the dismissal just because of a tweet or is there another story behind it? Was the tweet only used as a pretext?
