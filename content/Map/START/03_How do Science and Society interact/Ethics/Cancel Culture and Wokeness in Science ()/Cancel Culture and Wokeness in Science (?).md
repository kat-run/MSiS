**Abstract/Summary**

The terms ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù and ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù have been used extensively to describe the climate of our current debate culture, not just in general, but also in the epistemic realm. In the context of science and research they describe single instances or general trends, which indicate a certain culture of internal repression of certain (research-)topics (cancel culture) or enforced push towards social justice in science, either in the content of or the personnel of knowledge production (wokeness). As in general culture, the topic is debated controversy within the scientific community and it is not even agreed upon, whether the phenomena exist at all. In the following paragraphs, as well as in the branches of this node, I aim to provide a selection of material which should provide the basis for discussion, without drawing a conclusion.

Firstly, defining these terms is not straightforward as they are used in many different contexts, by many different actors and, most importantly, with different ideological connotations. Therefore, most scholars writing about ‚Äòwoke‚Äô or ‚Äòcancel culture‚Äô, refuse to give a clear definition of them. The answer to what defines the canceling of a person, whether it is termination of employment or backlash on social media, or which practices are considered as ‚Äúwoke‚Äù is hardly ever answered by any of the sides. However, it is important to note that in contemporary debate, they are used in an increasingly negative light with the implication that the push for social justice and the fear of overstepping, have gone too far and are now harming a nuanced debate. For instance, the term ‚Äòwoke‚Äô initially derives from the US civil rights movement and signified staying alert to injustice and protesting it and is almost exclusively used as a derogatory term by right-wing politicians and commentators (for instance the prase ‚Äòwoke mind virus‚Äô has been used by [Ron de Santis](https://www.messengernews.net/news/local-news/2023/07/desantis-pledges-to-fight-woke-mind-virus/) and [Elon Musk](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/08/13/elon-musk-s-ambition-repopulating-the-planet-and-destroying-the-woke-virus_6714239_4.html)). Besides being notoriously hard to define, wokeness, and especially cancel culture are also hard to pin down as a real trend and not just as a collection of single instances. ‚ÄúDebate about this phenomenon is heated, voluminous, and ultra-partisan, but plausible evidence has been scarce. ‚ÄúSilenced‚Äù views, by definition, are the classic case of the dog which did not bark. In America, right-wing spokespersons have weaponized the claim. Liberals, pushing back, skeptical about the dog‚Äôs existence, suggest that the very existence of the public argument demonstrates its falsity.‚Äù ([Norris, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Norris-2023-df232c7a50fb46f783e682d62ce1dcb8?pvs=21), p. 147).

The state of the discourse concerning wokeness in science and research is inextricably linked with the debates of wokeness in general culture because, on a more general level, any societal issue is linked to science and technology and, more specifically, many of the debates about wokeness and cancel culture have their origins in US universities while also most of the literature on the topic derives from the US (see for instance [Freeman, 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Freeman-2024-61eb44dd3a2c49cc849247173474a901?pvs=21)). The latest developments of the debate around wokeness and practices of cancel culture start in the second decade of this century but their roots go back further to early feminist- and other critical studies of the 1970 and 1980s. With the toolkit of these postmodern critiques, academic research fields of critical social theory with scholars like [Coates, 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Coates-2015-09440ea5379d4b4ab9ccf16833ab135c?pvs=21), [Kendall, 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Kendall-2020-3c0c3f94154040979b3c69a89065366c?pvs=21) and [DiAngelo, 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/DiAngelo-2019-d056681fd6b14e71a6ccc86236dc8907?pvs=21) have analyzed various mechanisms of intersectional oppression of woman, PoC, and other marginalized groups in our current Society. This current of research, has demonstrated systemic inequalities embedded in our societies. While the field itself did not explicitly use the label, scholars who did research on these topics were subsumed under a new stream of ‚Äòwoke‚Äô academic scholarship. In parallel and partly based on this research, Universities have adopted policies for furthering [[DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion)]], for instance in hiring processes, and practices of [[Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)]]. This kind of research, which also has close ties to [[Academic Activism]], and its effects on University policies can be perceived as uncomfortable or even as a threat to the majorly male, white academic establishment. [Prasad & ≈öliwa, 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Prasad-liwa-2024-21c708e0c38549e8bc2856e10723be76?pvs=21) argue that while ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù gets discussed in a negative light in broad terms whereas single measures of DEI are favored and agreed upon by the public, as well as on an institutional level: ‚Äúwhile such work is ostensibly framed within a broader critique of ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù, the arguments put forward by its authors are, in actuality, directed towards challenging organizations as sites where the privileges attached to membership in socially dominant groups are normalized and reproduced‚Äù ([Prasad & ≈öliwa, 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Prasad-liwa-2024-21c708e0c38549e8bc2856e10723be76?pvs=21), p. 245). [Neiman, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Neiman-2023-97664b7acb2a42a48e376b2e7e1f6f34?pvs=21) articulates a more substantial critique against wokeness by giving more of a procedural account: ‚ÄúCan woke be defined? It begins with concern for marginalized persons, and ends by reducing each to the prism of her marginalization. The idea of intersectionality might have emphasized the ways in which all of us have more than one identity. Instead, it led to focus on those parts of identities that are most marginalized, and multiplied them into a forest of trauma. Woke emphasizes the ways in which particular groups have been denied justice, and seeks to rectify and repair the damage. In the focus on inequalities of power, the concept of justice is often left by the wayside. Woke demands that nations and peoples face up to their criminal histories. In the process it often concludes that all history is criminal‚Äù ([Neiman, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Neiman-2023-97664b7acb2a42a48e376b2e7e1f6f34?pvs=21), p. 8). Hence, for Naiman, the original ideas of wokeness, namely the fight against inequality are positive and should be pursued. However, the sole focus on oppression and deconstruction of oppressive systems is not productive (a view for instance also shared by [Waldman & Sparr, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Waldman-Sparr-2023-d66514b373424bfc9d535d003676da87?pvs=21)).

A similar argument can be made for cancel culture. According to [Nida-R√ºmelin, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Nida-R-melin-2023-c00962d316684059933bb5bdde92eac9?pvs=21), cancel culture, the repression of contrary or undesirable opinions, has always been present in societal, as well as scholarly debates. However, as a society, which has to stay open to opinions, which are situated within the "constitutional ark", meaning which do not break any laws. If our society loses the ability to tolerate differences, the democratic project is endangered.  the current (social-) media landscape, as well as the multilateral and convoluted crises that often evade simple explanations. In this climate, ‚Äúcanceling‚Äú or ‚Äúdeplatforming‚Äù a controversial opinion is often preferred to an open debate. As a consequence, Nida-R√ºmelin sees cancel culture in its current form as ‚Äúnot compatible with civil culture‚Äù ([Nida-R√ºmelin, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Nida-R-melin-2023-c00962d316684059933bb5bdde92eac9?pvs=21), p.155). However, the current (social-) media landscape, as well as the multilateral and convoluted crises that often evade simple explanations, often make nuanced debated, which are held in good faith, an ideal, which is often hard to achieve. In this heated climate, ‚Äúcanceling‚Äú or ‚Äúdeplatforming‚Äù a controversial opinion is often preferred to an open debate, for the better or the worse. Other researchers (for instance [Huber, 2021]([https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Huber-2021-1288721018668156b908cfeb11eca823?pvs=4](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Huber-2021-1288721018668156b908cfeb11eca823?pvs=4)), therefore do not condone all instances of cancelling as harmful to public debate but differentiate. If representatives of an opinion, which has proven to be false, or bad-faith actors who have other interests in mind then a constructive debate, are given a platform to propagate those false beliefs, the debate can never move on to a productive stage. In other words, if a societal consensus about a topic is reached, it is not productive to give room to dissenting fringe opinions, who bring the discussion back to the beginning. Examples for this are climate change deniers (see also [Oreskes and Conway, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Oreskes-Conway-2022-5ecf7b3c139c4ab0ad4b30bca14ed91b?pvs=4)) . 

So what is the state of wokeness and cancel culture in science and research? Again, there is neither a clear definition of what the terms comprise, nor a general consensus that wokeness and cancel culture are even a problem in science and research.

Surveys indicate that there is indeed a trend towards self censoring at University campuses, both on the side of Professors ([Norris, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Norris-2023-df232c7a50fb46f783e682d62ce1dcb8?pvs=21)), as well as on the side of students ([Revers & Traunm√ºller, 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Revers-Traunm-ller-2020-13487210186681e8a123f959ec2b9d7b), [Villa et al., 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Villa-et-al-2021-daeab492a1554997bc82f8f2d541d907?pvs=21)). Importantly, both studies state that the stance taken on cancel culture depends greatly, weather one holds opinions of the proclaimed majority or not, no matter the political orientation: ‚ÄúWithin academia, scholars most likely to perceive ‚Äúsilencing‚Äù are mismatched or non congruent cases, where they are ‚Äúfish-out-of-water‚Äù.‚Äù ([Norris, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Norris-2023-df232c7a50fb46f783e682d62ce1dcb8?pvs=21), p. 145). From a demographic perspective, in the west, both college teachers, as well as students will be more likely to hold progressive values, hence opposing conservative opinion holders will be more likely to feel ‚Äúcanceled‚Äù. In countries with a more conservative mainstream, like Nigeria or the UAE, it is the other way round ([Norris, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Norris-2023-df232c7a50fb46f783e682d62ce1dcb8?pvs=21)). Consequently, especially scholars who research topics that are perceived to be outside of the mainstream thought collective ([Fleck, 2021 [1935]](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fleck-2021-1935-236cea2b81f74beeb37a9f1e2ebf4c49?pvs=21)), for instance, controversial research on sex and gender often seems to face a considerable backlash and ad hominem attacks, instead of scholarly debate ([Pfaus, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Pfaus-2023-bd4689c8fbc347d7bcceb47ba6c8f8f0?pvs=21), even though this particular evidence was the spark of a scholarly debate [Sterling et al., 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Sterling-et-al-2023-122872101866814b89b4cf5514fd1e53?pvs=4]). On the other hand, many studies, which have had a considerable influence on public debates about controversial subjects, have been retracted or corrected (see for instance [Broderick, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Broderick-2023-10b87210186681ad9119e034bb754d8b?pvs=21)). This links to broader discussions about [[Ethics]] in research and its purpose in society and the reduction of political discussions to claims about scientific correctness (see [[Die Epistemisierung des Politischen]]). In a world, where scientific expertise holds such a prominent place, research results often get utilized for political gain faster, than the scientific community can verify or test them. In this context, it is important for every researcher to closely look at the societal impact and possible implications of their research (see also [[Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)]])

The phenomenon of Cancel culture and Wokeness is neither unique to science, nor is science immune to  other broader cultural trends. Additionally, there seems to be a generational shift of the definition of freedom. While previous generations defined freedom as ‚Äòfreedom to‚Ä¶‚Äô younger generations increasingly demand ‚Äúfreedom from‚Ä¶‚Äù (terms first coined by Erich Fromm, vgl. [Buechler, 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Buechler-2024-552106a9a18a472aa0e1384012348841?pvs=21)), meaning they prize safety above the often uncomfortable freedom to articulate dissenting viewpoints. In order to describe the phenomenon, [Lukianoff & Haidt, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Lukianoff-Haidt-2018-86df04f2ed5748eb9c202baafc436346?pvs=21) coin the term ‚Äúsafetyism‚Äù, which ‚Äúrefers to a culture or belief system in which safety has become a sacred value, which means that people become unwilling to make trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. ‚ÄúSafety‚Äù trumps everything else, no matter how unlikely or trivial the potential danger.‚Äù ([Lukianoff & Haidt, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Lukianoff-Haidt-2018-86df04f2ed5748eb9c202baafc436346?pvs=21), 2018, p. 36). This argument is also shared by scholars like Stephen Pinker, who is a founder of the [[Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard]]: ‚ÄúWe are increasingly living in an era in which students do not prize resilience, they prize vulnerability and safety, and I don‚Äôt mean physical safety but safety from ideas they find disagreeable,‚Äù Pinker says [‚Ä¶], ‚Äúwe think the university should get out of the business of opening on what‚Äôs right or wrong‚Äù [Freeman, 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Freeman-2024-61eb44dd3a2c49cc849247173474a901?pvs=21).

In summary, instances of cancellation of undesired positions in academia and an increasing awareness of ‚Äúwoke‚Äù topics such as discrimination and equity are present in our current science system. However the extent of the issue, as well as the consequences of this cultural shift are very controversial amongst the scientific community and, researching this topic, it is hard to distinguish genuine concern from diningeneous fearmongering and pursuit of political agendas. Scholars need to be aware of systems of privilege and oppression and try to overcome them, however, they also need to be aware of the dominance of strains of thought in research and make sure, that also marginalized and divergent arguments and research gets the freedom (provided it itself is done according to good standards and in good faith) to be able to exist in the system*.

Lastly, to put the discourse to scale, however divided political, sociological and philosophical scholars might be on the phenomenon of wokeness and cancel culture, there is almost unanimous agreement that they are not the biggest threat to our contemporary society: ‚ÄúThe greatest current threat to democracy as a form of government and way of life does not come from left-wing cancel culture, but - at least in most European countries - from right-wing populist forces. These are however strengthened by cultural and political maldevelopments, which include the spreading cancel culture [...] It may even be the case that those extreme challenges are helping to overcome the internal ones‚Äù ([Nida-R√ºmelin, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Nida-R-melin-2023-c00962d316684059933bb5bdde92eac9?pvs=21), p. 10).

  

**There are many further questions that can be debated in this context:**

- When does a list of incidents become a ‚Äúculture‚Äù?
- Does wokeness and cancel culture help or harm knowledge production?
- If safety is a priority, does wokeness or cancel culture actually make people safer?
- If we don‚Äôt deplatform or cancel, how can we make sure that no people arguing in bad faith capture the discourse (Popper‚Äôs paradox of tolerance).
- Do we have to redefine safe space as ‚ÄúSafe space to.‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúSafe Space from‚Ä¶‚Äù?

  

*Another issue with many contributions to the debate about ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù and ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù is, that they are not done in good faith but that ideological conceptions (in the western context mostly conservative ideology) is set as the starting point for looking at certain incidents. This made stringent data collection on this issue hard as a large part of the material does not meet quality criteria of scientific literature or otherwise credible news sources. An example for this is a [list of incidents of ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù](https://www.nas.org/blogs/article/tracking-cancel-culture-in-higher-education), compiled by the National association of Scholars, a conservative NGO in the US. I did not include this list in the data for this map because it did not meet quality criteria, for instance it mostly cited boulevard newspapers like the New York post or self-referential blogs from the conservative activist ecosystem. However, I still want to mention this list in this footnote. Of the first 100 incidents that were reported as cancel culture, only less than a quarter led to traceable consequences like termination or resignation. The rest of the incidents‚Äô consequences consisted mostly of social media outrage over statements, disciplinary investigations with no further consequences other than sensitivity training or student petitions.
