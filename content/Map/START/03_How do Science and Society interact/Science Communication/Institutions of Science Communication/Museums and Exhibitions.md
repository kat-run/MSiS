**Abstract/Summary**

Science museums and science centers are important building blocks of science communication. Especially for younger audiences, museum visits can be a gateway into the world of science: ‚ÄúMost schoolchildren have experienced trips to natural history and science museums, and, outside of formal schooling, museums and similar institutions are perceived as key sites for informal science education. Such institutions have developed from a focus on the collection and display of objects to including interactive elements and using film and audio to advance learning.‚Äù ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21), p. 7). It is important, to understand museums as sites of not purely scientific learning, but of cultural learning, and that a visit to the museum is important for a ‚Äúcollective appropriation of knowledge‚Äù ([Schiele, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schiele-2021-475292424df943a48b5da543cf4329a5?pvs=21), p. 73), meaning it is important that visitors make the knowledge ‚Äòtheir own‚Äô and appreciate science, rather than memorize the facts.

Museums, in most contexts, fulfill a double role. On the one hand, they are sites of preservation. Many museums are in charge of collections which they have to maintain and make available for research; sometimes museums also do research on their own. For instance, the [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/) in Vienna has large zoological, geological and botanical collection, a majority of which is not on display for the public and are maintained and researched. The second main role of museums is oriented towards the public. In short, ‚Äúthey seek to further public understanding of science and technology in an en lightening and entertaining manner and do not require any special interest or background to be understood or appreciated by the average person‚Äù ([Danilov, 1982](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Danilov-1982-cd76751b62bd40d8beb8645366776b92?pvs=21), p. 2). Hence, also museums have to be very sensitive to it‚Äôs publics.

The development of science museums and science centers is interesting to set alongside the development of science and technology in general. Science museums and centers went from displaying the history and progress of Technology and science to the public in a very one-sided (deficit-model) way, to the emphasizing accessibility and knowledge acquisition (dialogue-model) all the way to addressing relevant societal issues and seeing themselves as part of society: ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the 1980s, the public was no longer satisfied with a science detached from social realities. It expected SMCs to tackle controversial subjects because the capacity of citizens to form opinions on questions they deemed im portant was at stake. At the same time, the deteriorating economic situation forced museums to review their objectives and rethink their ways of doing things‚Äù ([Schiele, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schiele-2021-475292424df943a48b5da543cf4329a5?pvs=21), p. 64).

As sites of both, science learning and preservation, these institutions a balance between being consistent and being relevant and sparking people‚Äôs interests. Most museums try this by having a core-collection, which also has historical value, and adding temporary special exhibitions to the program ([Schiele, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Schiele-2021-475292424df943a48b5da543cf4329a5?pvs=21)). Additionally, many science museums have added interactive elements to their program, where visitors can experience elements of the research process and get an idea of how science works in real life; even though they get a ‚Äúclean‚Äù version and the messiness of the scientific process is contained (see for instance [Felt & Fochler, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-Fochler-2013-63ea1d5bbc1043be9fd0f94c7f750169?pvs=21)).
