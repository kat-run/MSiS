### Changes in Institutional Science Communication - the Struggles for a Place in the Sun

The role in scientific Institutions, like Universities or research institutes, in science communication is key to understanding many of the practices of contemporary science communication ([Sch√§fer & F√§hnrich, 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Sch-fer-F-hnrich-2020-659d14f0de9544efbe4ae9960ffe77f8?pvs=21)). In recent years there has been a considerable increase of science communication activities promoted by institutions. Most Universities and Research Institutions nowadays have communication departments where they employ communication specialists, not only for the dissemination of research to the media and the public, but also to engage in strategic communication, for instance devising PR campaigns or engage in stakeholder relations-building on behalf of the institutions ([Scanu, 2006](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Scanu-2006-7a7a9ec0147e492d8bb2515debf6896e?pvs=21)). This professionalisation, in context with the above described mechanisms of marketization of research in general, leads to several changes in the conceptualisation and execution of science communication under the lead of scientific research institutions and Universities: ‚ÄúIf the pressures of contemporary market-driven ideologies are re-shaping science, they are also reshaping science communication‚Äù ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21), p. 126). Most notably, these changes include a shifted thematic focus, a focus on interdisciplinarity, relevance and excellence ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21), [Felt & Fochler, 2012](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-Fochler-2012-fff87210186681e4aa1ef025e7cc6f30?pvs=21), [Fochler et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fochler-et-al-2016-ad0d5bd0a02b4a6dbd76470719c25638?pvs=21)), echoing the changes of the epistemic system that [Nowotny et al., 2004](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Nowotny-et-al-2004-b55fa0e431414b2883eebf22e1d34b62?pvs=21) call ‚ÄúMode 2‚Äù science or knowledge. Besides this shift of content, there is also a notable shift on the personal focus of science communication, meaning _who_ is talked about and who gets the credit for scientific discoveries. Under the influence of institutions taking over science communication in a professionalised manner, the focus shifts from the individual scientists‚Äô to the institution; meaning when a University‚Äôs press department communicates, the success is framed rather as an achievement of the University, rather than an individual scientist or a certain discipline [(](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?d9Rn7n)[Marcinkowski et al., 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Marcinkowski-et-al-2014-63246b0abd88476a81db6352d58c0474?pvs=21) [Peters et al., 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Peters-et-al-2008-6e1e39615ab548fabed21613434074c9?pvs=21)). Hand in hand with this shift comes a new class of professional science communicators, often with a background in the natural sciences, who has started to emerge in the science communication landscape and takes on an intermediate role between the organization and the realm of epistemic research [(](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?pVhoaK)[Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21)), even though a considerable part of science communication is still being done by the researchers themselves.

Hence, not only science and research itself but also science communication is increasingly subjected to the new logics and dynamics described in the previous sections. This also has an effect on the researchers, who have a desire to reach out to the public and engage in science communication. Therefore, in the next section, I will go deeper into the relationship between communicating scientists and their institution and the tensions that surround scientists‚Äô involvement in science communication.
