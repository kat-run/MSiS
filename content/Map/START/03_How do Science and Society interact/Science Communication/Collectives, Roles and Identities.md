### Collectives, Roles and Identities Communicating Science

Scientists have a multitude of intertwined motives to communicate to the public, which are in most cases a mixture between ‚Äòsocial responsibility‚Äô or ‚Äòstakeholder-oriented‚Äô reasons. In the same rationale, when communication happens, there are many underlying dynamics, values and norms, both from the part of scientists, as well as from institutions, that tacitly shape how science communication is conceptualised and practised. Therefore, in the next paragraph, I will point towards the importance of collectives in science communication, the different roles that scientists take on when interacting with the public and the process of identity-building that comes with these processes.

When looking at science communication from an STS perspective, it is important to keep in mind that scientists do not communicate out of a social vacuum: ‚ÄúIt is not just about scientists and their audiences, but about wider groups and collectives‚Äù ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21), p. 57). Meaning scientists are always part of different groups and spheres of influence and embody and enact these different affiliations and relationships when they communicate. Collectives, in this context, can be their peers who are at the same stage of their career, researchers who are affiliated with the same institution or the epistemic field that the scientists do research on; but also of other social circles outside of the professional realm, like activist groups. Hence, If scientists communicate to a public, they do not just speak for themselves but also for all these collectives and communities. Even if they do not officially act as a spokesperson for these collectives, for instance when they participate in a science outreach activity, they tacitly embody them in every interaction with the public, which, in turn, feeds back on the collectives themselves and on their identity as scientists: ‚Äú[Scientists‚Äô] public communication is not just about them and their audiences but about a community that they want to represent or demonstrate (or simply not embarrass themselves in front of )‚Äù ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21), p. 65). These different collectives can exist alongside or even be mutually reinforcing each other in their values and aims, but they can also be at odds with each other and create a field of tension between different spheres of interest, which in turn creates tensions for the person communicating with multiple collective affiliations. A conflict of collectives that has been of interest in the field of research on science communication, is the tension between institutional science communication goals and cultures and the scientists‚Äô objectives as communicators and/or researchers [Watermeyer, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Watermeyer-2016-b81621184ef1440fa24ebc289bc4e60e?pvs=21), [Watermeyer & Tomlinson, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Watermeyer-Tomlinson-2022-21fc6a84cd32453ca04e2f9509d9b068?pvs=21), [Weingart & Joubert, 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Weingart-Joubert-2019-dc2eb87ca5ef4bee8fcf9a17be692235?pvs=21)).

In addition to being part of different collectives, scientists can take on different roles when they communicate ([Horst, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Horst-2013-88c38a56c4b84896955ce78e9eb58503?pvs=21)): They can speak as ‚Äúexperts'' for their respective fields, in which they aim to disseminate information to relevant audiences, as ‚Äúresearch managers'', in which they communicate as stand-ins for a certain organisation or project and try to secure advantages for these, or as ‚Äúguardians of science‚Äù, in which they speak for _Science_ itself, meaning ‚Äúscience as a social institution (‚ÄòScience‚Äô with a capital S)‚Äù ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21), p. 64). Which one of these roles a scientist/communicator assumes in which circumstance and which ones they choose to assume, depends greatly on the situation. In any case however, by acting as a representative of any topic or cause, the communicators inherently identify with it and simultaneously are perceived by the audience as an identifier from the outside.

Hence, scientists never just speak on their own; but they also do not become what they are on their own. Because they represent different collectives and assume different roles when engaging with the public, communication is fundamentally important for the formation of scientists‚Äô identities: ‚ÄúScience communication is used by scientists for many different identity-building purposes, in many different ways. It further relates to different kinds of communities‚Äù [(Davies, 2021)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Xvnoph). Especially for younger generations of scientists, communication in different ways or forms, for instance via social media, has become an integral part of the formation of their identity ([Baram-Tsabari & Lewenstein, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Baram-Tsabari-Lewenstein-2017-82c9c849f49941d7b25b344d0e26af5a?pvs=21), [J√ºnger & F√§hnrich, 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/J-nger-F-hnrich-2020-fa62bf08bb714d809fae8a34c9a76662?pvs=21)). In this process of identity formation, epistemic and societal narratives or narrative infrastructures [(](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?bYTpqZ)[Felt, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2017-cbcdcb1df1244a3d83f4531b2091d9c3?pvs=21)) play a role. Narratives and narrative infrastructures influence all the above-mentioned processes that contribute to the formation of a science communication event, as well as to the formation of a scientist‚Äôs identity. The embeddedness of scientists in different collectives - in- and outside of the epistemic community-, scientists‚Äô notions of the public and of the nature of science communication - whether it be oriented on a deficit- or dialogue- assumption-, the scientists‚Äô incentives for communication, and the different roles they assume when communicating, all have a tacit influence on how this identity is formed and performed in the arena of science communication ([Davies, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-2021-73a29a391ae843f2b8d58f8811f612ac?pvs=21), [Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21)). It is important to see this process is fundamentally relational, complex and performative. Collectives, roles and identities are never static, as both the scientists, collectives and audiences can shift in their composition and allegiances and can therefore not be considered as fixed categories ([Davies, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-2021-73a29a391ae843f2b8d58f8811f612ac?pvs=21)). As a consequence, the process, how collectives, roles and identities are formed, depends greatly on the circumstances that a scientist finds themselves in, especially in their early careers ([Mula et al., 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Mula-et-al-2022-8d68d584c8844a7a90188de376dc1c0a?pvs=21)).
