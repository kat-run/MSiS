**Abstract/Summary**

As science communication developed from a deficit-model to a dialogue-oriented understanding, also the notion of the audience has changed. Research about science communication adopted the term ‚Äòpublics‚Äô, as opposed to a uniform ‚Äòpublic‚Äô, to emphasize the heterogeneity of the audience of science communication efforts and encouraging science communicators to pay attention to ‚Äú the various understandings, beliefs and attitudes within the public.‚Äù ([Bucchi & Trench, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bucchi-Trench-2016-45727911e88d4733b648c17a1dd74fc5?pvs=21) p. 158).

These various understandings, beliefs and attitudes may derive from demographic factors like age, gender and socioeconomic status, however they also go beyond that and are influenced by personal convictions, like trust in experts and medicine or interest in technology. All to these, and more, factors together form a relationship of a certain individual with science. Getting a grasp of this fluid relationship is not easy. In contemporary science communication research, there is a considerable amount of research into different audiences of science communication ([Sch√§fer & Metag, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Sch-fer-Metag-2021-80384e76089748c991181beae89333c5?pvs=21)). An approximation can be achieved through studying survey data, like the ‚Äú[Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/science-technology-innovation)‚Äù-survey initiative, which regularly monitors EU citizens‚Äô opinions and trust about science and technology ([Bauer & Falade, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bauer-Falade-2021-f949bde87940467ab6138dbd8b78e1d5?pvs=21)).

Fluid individuals form equally fluid publics: ‚Äúeach issue can create its own public, and each public will not normally consist of the same individuals who make up any other particular public ‚Äì though any individual can, at any given time, be a member of many other publics.‚Äù ([Einsiedel, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Einsiedel-2021-1b4c853938f743d4b2751d5a7a63740b?pvs=21) p. 268). For instance, a school class who visits a museum might be considered one uniform public since they belong to the same demographic. But in reality it consists of many different personalities with different interests. Some of which might be enthusiastic about the exhibition, some might find it boring unless they are stimulated in a certain way, some might not want to engage with it at all and are ‚Äòforced‚Äô to participate. Any communication effort, not just concerning science, needs to be attentive to this heterogeneity.

Hence, knowing and defining one‚Äôs audience (for instance with the help of surveys) is crucial for the success of any science communication effort. Especially in the contemporary science and media landscape, whose only unifying feature is its fractured nature. However, a focus which is too tailored to a certain audience, especially in the online space, also has specific drawbacks: Firstly, it might lead to communicators increasingly focusing on audiences who are already interested in science which neglects those who need to be ‚Äòconvinced‚Äô by science communication. And secondly, this might lead to a further polarization of the audience, as ‚Äúdifferent segments of the population may increasingly oppose one another, particularly around contested scientific issues that are tied to political ideology and sociocultural worldviews‚Äù ([Sch√§fer & Metag, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Sch-fer-Metag-2021-80384e76089748c991181beae89333c5?pvs=21), p. 295).
