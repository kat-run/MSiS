**Abstract/Summary**

Science and the media are inextricably linked through science communication and beyond. In our contemporary knowledge society, science plays a huge role in the mass media, for instance through television ([Kirby & Ockert, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Kirby-Ockert-2021-40aceed104c14c4a8cb26f92c974fb02?pvs=21)), popular science books ([Azzouni, 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Azzouni-2015-c0d803af39904213a934b677c34014d5?pvs=21)), on social media ([Liang et al., 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Liang-et-al-2014-abcce1da15574eaa807952d467cc11d4?pvs=21)) etc. The relationship of science and the media is a vast field of research, [Weingart, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Weingart-2022-09a90e4fa980427dbf3711fa04406076?pvs=21) delivers a comprehensive overview over the development of this relationship from the end of WWII until today. It is important to stress that a close science-media relationship has been an important focus of the political project of science communication since the beginning of institutional science communication (see for instance [Bodmer, 1985](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bodmer-1985-faf4068aebf14729b72eabd1007321d4?pvs=21)). In practice however, these relations are much more complex than initially imagined by scientists and policymakers, especially when it comes to controversial topics such as GMOs or atomic energy ([Hilgartner, 1990](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Hilgartner-1990-eca5a736eb13469b99438fee92a79e60?pvs=21), [Felt, 1999](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-1999-ad50400f233a4825b13d11f15d819403?pvs=21) [Felt, 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-2015-89b1ad29648d46faa948bf7b604a1ebb?pvs=21))

The relationship between Science and the media has been examined through the theoretical lens of the ‚Äúmedialization‚Äù of science ([Weingart, 1998](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Weingart-1998-e97d21d32e1b42288a8765e18c50f675?pvs=21), [R√∂dder, 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/R-dder-2009-cdba6ef955464068a74bab83b31385d8?pvs=21)). This theory comprises a twofold development: on the one hand the media, be it mass media or news media, has developed an increasing orientation towards science, for instance by scientists providing [[Expertise]] to current topics such as the Covid pandemic. On the other hand, also science itself has been oriented more and more towards the media: ‚ÄúThe process of medialization in particular means that scientific institutions as well as scientists increasingly orient themselves towards public and media attention rather than the truth.‚Äù ([R√∂dder, 2009](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/R-dder-2009-cdba6ef955464068a74bab83b31385d8?pvs=21) p. 454).

Some scholars of medialization claim, that these developments, in conjunction with [[The Marketization of Science]], may lead to an ecosystem, that is more oriented towards science-PR than science communication and knowledge production and that this self-servicing way of communicating scientific advances is ultimately eroding the trust in science: ‚ÄúA closer look reveals the self-referentiality of institutional communication deriving its rationale from ‚Äòimagined publics‚Äô. The politically sponsored ‚Äòengagement of the public‚Äô has been derailed to become marketing, branding and public relations exercises. The unintended consequences of the establishment of communication units and the blurring of science communication and persuasion are conflicts between faculty and management and possibly a loss of trust in science.‚Äù (Weingart, 2022, p. 288).

While this trend can definitely be observed, not all science communication efforts can be reduced to science-marketing efforts. There are a multitude of motivations for people and institutions to engage in science communication and most of the time it is a mixture of goal-oriented and ideological reasons. (Science-) communication is always an act of ‚Äúmeaning-making‚Äù ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21)), in which scientists, communicators and publics share a common idea, a community and a common view of a certain topic which serves to make sense of the world. By communicating science, not just the facts are transported, but also the identities and collectives surrounding the pursuit of knowledge production. Therefore it is important to acknowledge the context-specificity of the relationship between science and the media and motives beyond self-serving science PR.

Especially in the current diversified media-ecosystem, where so called mass media are no longer the primary information source and most people curate their own media-diet through social media: ‚Äúthe boundaries of communication that exist between scientists, journalists, and public audiences become more blurred‚Äù ([Liang et al., 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Liang-et-al-2014-abcce1da15574eaa807952d467cc11d4?pvs=21), p. 774). There is a variety of non-traditional science news outlets which gain a much broader audience than traditional news media (see for instance [IFLS (I f***ing love science)](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/IFLS-I-f-ing-love-science-49b9f69f4e8a424aa2ed35eaa4af9f87?pvs=21)) In this increasingly messy system, professionlised science communication is especially important to make sure that ‚Äúthe public are provided with balanced, accurate and critically interpreted information. The challenges that exist in the face of this contemporary environment are not for scientists or journalists to battle on their own. Instead, these challenges must be tackled by way of scientists, science communicators and journalists working collaboratively to produce constructive content that the public are confident in and feel are a trustworthy source.‚Äù ([Dempster, 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Dempster-2020-1acd7ce7c6ca4dd69b3cff3f54e2ca88?pvs=21) , p. 4).

In a rapidly expanding science landscape, this need for curated and funded information is one of the reasons for the professionalization of science communication and the need for specialized mediation. An example for this mediation is the emergence of Science-Media-Centers as independent intermediary institutions between science and the media. SMCs, for instance in [Germany](https://www.sciencemediacenter.de/) and the [UK](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/), and are financed independently by the public. They serve both the media in form of curated information about science and research, a pool of experts and connections with institutional press offices and scientists with resources for engaging in communication, as well as with training offers. While this form of pre-packaged information might be an obstacle for independent and critical journalism in times of limited resources, thus favoring the practice of ‚Äúchurnalism‚Äù, they help journalists navigate an increasingly complex science system and bring information to their readers ([Fox & Louis, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Fox-Louis-2013-0ac6f8fe44c6403c919267d528868e44?pvs=21)).

In summary, as the world of science gets more complex, also the discipline of science communication and the relationship between science and the media gets more layered and situated. The motives of scientists and institutions to communicate are neither purely altruistic nor purely interest-driven. In this context, it is important to recognize concerning trends of medialization which could erode the public trust in science, but also to recognize the value that intermediaries between science and the media, such as Science Media Centers and professional science communicators bring to the ever more complex landscape of science and the media.
