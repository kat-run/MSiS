**Abstract/Summary**

A reproach, that is often mentioned concerning the liaison between science and the media in an increasingly competitive landscape, is that through the medialization process, science gets ‚Äòoversold‚Äô to the public: ‚Äúunder the regime of competition for resources and public attention and the proximity to the media, the risk of the organization to fall prey to the strategies of questionable actors has increased considerably.‚Äù ([Weingart, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Weingart-2022-09a90e4fa980427dbf3711fa04406076?pvs=21) p. 293). In this view, the media themselves get the blame for this, but a closer look reveals a much more complex issue behind this. [Joly, 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Joly-2010-a1ba17c3b7b94ca580326175522dc693?pvs=21) calls this an ‚Äúeconomics of promises‚Äù.

First it has to be mentioned that certain mechanisms of the mass media do favor the ‚Äúoverselling‚Äù of science. The prime example for this is social media, which ‚Äúselect‚Äù for the most engaging content. Additionally, underfunded newsrooms with less specialized journalistic staff often are not able to deliver a nuanced picture of complex science stories; what is published is often reduced to an (exaggerated) headline. There are numerous examples of when research has been oversold to the public, from the ‚Äú[Theranos](https://www.panmacmillan.com/blogs/literary/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-john-carreyrou)‚Äù-scandal to daily headlines about why a certain food is considered good -or bad- for your health (for instance ‚Äú‚Äú[Six chocolate bars a week could be good for your heart](https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/six-chocolate-bars-a-week-could-be-good-for-the-heart-20170524-gwbq62.html)‚Äù).

However, the media is not the sole contributor to this. Concerning science stories in newspapers, for instance, it has been shown that press departments of universities play a key role in overselling the research that they want the media to turn into news stories: ‚Äúit has been shown that, science and health related news that was based on a press release, the main sources of exaggeration, were the press releases themselves‚Äù ([Dempster, 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Dempster-2020-1acd7ce7c6ca4dd69b3cff3f54e2ca88?pvs=21), p. 3). From the institutional perspective, this means that, in a system, where attention is an important currency, institutional science communicators have the most incentive to make their content as interesting as possible and therefore often oversell it: ‚Äúit is unfair to blame the media or other actors for over-selling science. As we have seen, scientists and scientific organizations themselves play a crucial part in producing the visions that science media may take up: these days, in competitive and marketised university systems, strategic promising is integral to research. Promises and visions are in many contexts simply part of ‚Äòdoing science‚Äô,‚Äù ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21) , p. 147).

The last point is crucial to understand this dynamic. Science has always been using promises and predictions of the future in a very strategic manner. [Felt & Wynne, 2007](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Felt-Wynne-2007-2b5cd78c7a94432187eeffe9fd2df19f?pvs=21) describe the main features of what they call ‚Äúeconomics of technoscientific promise (ETP)‚Äù in the context of innovation in society:

1. Promises are used to attract resources, financial, political, personal. Here, the rhetoric is often formulated like a self fulfilling prophecy: If enough resources are provided, then a certain promise will be fulfilled. In short, promises are performative. Hence, the formulation of a goal (no matter if it is realistic or not) is needed for the competition for resources.
2. Promises are fueled by uncertain futures. In our contemporary societal discourse, for instance when talking about climate change, the uncertain effects of current practices on future generations are tacitly implied ([Joly, 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Joly-2010-a1ba17c3b7b94ca580326175522dc693?pvs=21)). Providing solutions to future problems, and thus narrowing uncertainties, is a powerful tool.
3. Technoscientific promises thrive in an environment of competition. Teh narrative is that if societies do not innovate and embrace technoscientific progress, they will fall behind.
4. For scientists, the economy of promises are associated with credit and credibility. They have to strike a balance between formulating promises in order to gain resources and being able to hold them and be held accountable. This has great implications on the science system, for instance when it comes to patenting of research results.

Hence, promises and anticipation are an integral part of how science is done and how it interacts with our contemporary society. In combination with an ever greater competition for attention, all actors are endangered to fall prey to the overselling of science.

The consequence of overselling science and not living up to promises is an eroding public trust in science and scientists. If promises are not fulfilled, or if contradictory promises are framed as the ultimate truth without taking into account that all results are somewhat preliminary, in short by not reflecting the _messiness_ of the scientific process, the public value of science is diminished. Some scientists, like the economist GerdWagner, see this as a call for humility: ‚ÄúBeing much more modest would certainly increase the credibility of science. This should be taught in universities, at the latest on the PhD level: modesty should be taught as an integral part of modern research ethics‚Äù [Wagner, 2018](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wagner-2018-b65b0b931f8a402f89a1d6f89a8a8aca?pvs=21). On the other hand, in a marketized science system that is hinged on technoscientific promises, single scientists cannot take the whole blame for mobilizing the resources available to them: ‚Äúwhile there is pressure on scientific funding, and where competition is based around strategic usefulness to society, researchers and policy makers will construct futures to help argue their case‚Äù ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21), p. 152).
