**Abstract/Summary**

A very important - yet often overlooked and underresearched - area of science communication are public information campaigns: ‚ÄúAs the welfare state expanded in the twentieth century, it increasingly took upon itself to guide the lives of its subjects with factual information campaigns about how to live a healthy life. Today such information is not restricted to health campaigns but spans many diverse areas of life: sustainability, energy, leisure activities, household waste‚Äù [Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21), p. 7). One very notable example are information campaigns during the Covid 19 epidemic.

These campaigns usually differ somewhat from the audience specificity that other areas of science communication has to follow. Usually, In this type of communication, the audience is deliberately broad. Most public information campaigns should reach as many people as possible. But this does not mean, that the audience has ti be ill-defined or that campaigns are always designed around the smallest common denominator. A well-designed campaign can consist of several smaller, more targeted, instances of communication, which can be directed at different audiences or via different media ([Solovei & Putte, 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Solovei-Putte-2020-5b0f26a9b2964db3ab189e64d3e35093?pvs=21)). It also ‚Äúrequires the disciplined development of strategies based on careful analysis of the situation, sensitive application of communication theory, and regular use of evaluation research‚Äù ([Atkin & Salmon, 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Atkin-Salmon-2010-493f5d1563744c50a19986fbca4fd805?pvs=21), p. 440).

Answering the question of how impactful such campaigns, are in general, there is no straightforward answer, as the outcome always depends on the campaign itself. However, several studies found a general trend for information campaigns on public health: the effectiveness of such campaigns is rather limited, with about 10% of the people reached by the campaign follow the communicated guidelines ([Atkin & Salmon, 2010](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Atkin-Salmon-2010-493f5d1563744c50a19986fbca4fd805?pvs=21)). These numbers generally show the inefficiency of communication along the lines of the deficit model, but still show, that this type of communication is not entirely a futile endeavor. After all, habits surrounding health are difficult to change and communication campaigns are notoriously hard to evaluate ([Coffmann, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Coffmann-2022-85de7699ba3544568fac44ee96f07900?pvs=21))

It is important, to see public campaigns not as standalone communication efforts but always consider the societal context, in which they are devised and the incentives behind the campaign. Governmentally issued campaigns ‚Äúdeliberately attempt to shape public attitudes, values, or behavior in the hope of reaching some desirable social outcome. In other words, they are a tool or instrument of government action‚Äù ([Weiss & Tschirhart, 1994](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Weiss-Tschirhart-1994-5d9f795d7b4345aea05247c2af2d38bc?pvs=21) p. 82). As such, they implicitly contain values that are often hidden behind a seemingly objective message, and given credibility through their proximity to science (in this context, see also [Bogner, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bogner-2021-33dcb119f4e44d6fa16254a29738978c?pvs=21)).
