Communication by scientists with policy makers and attentive publics raises ethical issues. Scientists need to decide how to communicate knowledge effectively in a way that nonscientists can understand and use, while remaining honest scientists and presenting estimates of the uncertainty of their inferences. They need to understand their own ethical choices in using scientific information to communicate to audiences. These issues were salient in the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change with respect to possible sea level rise from disintegration of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets. Due to uncertainty, the reported values of projected sea level rise were incomplete, potentially leading some relevant audiences to underestimate future risk. Such judgments should be made in a principled rather than an ad hoc manner. Five principles for scientific communication under such conditions are important:¬†_honesty_,¬†_precision_,¬†_audience relevance_,¬†_process transparency_, and¬†_specification of uncertainty about conclusions_. Some of these principles are of intrinsic importance while others are merely instrumental and subject to trade-offs among them. Scientists engaged in assessments under uncertainty should understand these principles and which trade-offs are acceptable.

Uncertainty is supposed to be the most underrated element of science communication. While being a crucial part of scientific research, uncertainty is perceived by the recipients of science communication as unwanted and prone to create mistakes and malfunction in everyday life. Nevertheless, uncertainty can and should play a significant role in science communication. A growing number of studies deals with different aspects of uncertainty and gives valuable ideas on how to implement the concept of uncertainty into science interpretation and communication. This article will draw the attention to the multidimensional characteristics of uncertainty. Since decision-makers have to consider variability, uncertainty, and probability into feasibility analysis, we show that the communication of the scientific surplus value of these concepts must be centered within modern science communication efforts. A special focus will be on the use of the concepts of uncertainty and variability within interpretive and educational programs in museum environments.

Uncertainty is inherent to science and science communication. However, the evidence appears mixed regarding whether portraying uncertainty in science communication has positive or negative effects. We review a diverse range of experimental literature (_k_‚Äâ=‚Äâ48; from 40 searches and 8000 retrievals), summarize the extant findings, and observe how the effects vary across four different types of communicated uncertainty (_deficient, technical, scientific_, and¬†_consensus uncertainty_). The results indicate that most findings of negative effects (such as reduced credibility and beliefs) are from experiments that operationalized uncertainty as disagreement or conflict in science (_consensus uncertainty_). In this review, consensus uncertainty was never found to have positive effects. In contrast, uncertainty in the form of quantified error ranges and probabilities (_technical uncertainty_) in these studies has had only positive or null effects, not negative effects. We also highlight frequent moderators of the effects of uncertainty, such as prior beliefs and worldviews.

All science has uncertainty. Unless that uncertainty is communicated effectively, decision makers may put too much or too little faith in it. The information that needs to be communicated depends on the decisions that people face. Are they (_i_) looking for a signal (e.g., whether to evacuate before a hurricane), (_ii_) choosing among fixed options (e.g., which medical treatment is best), or (_iii_) learning to create options (e.g., how to regulate nanotechnology)? We examine these three classes of decisions in terms of how to characterize, assess, and convey the uncertainties relevant to each. We then offer a protocol for summarizing the many possible sources of uncertainty in standard terms, designed to impose a minimal burden on scientists, while gradually educating those whose decisions depend on their work. Its goals are better decisions, better science, and better support for science.
