**Abstract/Summary**

Science communication is often focused on the positive aspects of science. The purpose of science communication is often to convince people of the endeavor of science and innovation or to motivate younger people to choose a career in science. Positive emotions like awe, wonder or fascination are heavily emphasized in science communication activities ([Luna & Bering, 2020](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Luna-Bering-2020-3118c2372c164199b899b86bf64481c0?pvs=21), [Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21)). But how can science communication tackle ‚Äúinconvenient truths‚Äù, like the effects of climate change with the goal of bringing about changes so that the ‚Äúinconvenient outcomes‚Äù might be mitigated?

First of all, communication along the deficit model is neither effective nor desirable concerning these topics. Just stating the facts, for instance the effects of global warming, does not : ‚ÄúIn a complex and demanding situation, public communication becomes much more than ‚Äògetting the science across‚Äô.‚Äù ([Irwin, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Irwin-2021-1af841ee9ae2474ca3e02e81a7fe9744?pvs=21), p. 148). Top-down dissenination of knowledge does not lead to more acceptance because it does not convey trust in the messengers (ibid.). Instead, dialogue-oriented deliberative formats have shown to be promising in various national contexts. An example for this is the Austrian ‚Äú[Klimarat](https://klimarat.org/)‚Äù, in which scientific research about climate change was heeded and specific actions to mitigate climate change were proposed to the government. This approach works especially well in contexts with a strong deliberative tradition, like the nordic countries, but also has its own drawbacks, like pre-selection processes or the quencing of marginalized opinions in the deliberative process (see for instance [√Årnason, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/rnason-2013-2ad56054964d436f9ff068ff0eb582ac?pvs=21), [Chilvers & Kearnes, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Chilvers-Kearnes-2016-10e2cf11b8324bd3bbbd405fdc61d782?pvs=21), [Wynne, 2006](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wynne-2006-fff87210186681eba73dd9ce0b102dbd?pvs=21)).

Additionally, not everybody can be part of a deliberative format. The question that arises is how climate communication can reach a broad audience and lead to lasting change, both in personal habits, as well as in policy. This question is highly relevant, for instance in sustainability research. Interestingly, also sustainability communication is mostly focused on the positive aspects of a change towards sustainability, like long-term progress, green jobs, renewable energies, etc.. therefore, one strategy of communicating ‚Äúinconvenient truths‚Äù could be to stress the positive outcomes of mitigating strategies. However, this communication alone might not suffice to bring about change, since changing towards a more sustainable economy does need drastic changes ans is an real inconvenience. concealing or denying this, erodes public trust as well.

Hence, communicating the negative aspects, like the changing of unsustainable habits in diets and mobility remains a challenge for sustainability communication. [Voci & Karmasin, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Voci-Karmasin-2023-6446c6c8fedb470290f6c12f1d1b4466?pvs=21) suggest a differentiated and targeted communication strategy according to the level of acceptance of- and trust in climate science. For instance, people who believe in climate change and want to do something about it, might be persuaded to adopt unpleasant changes by evoking emotions, whereas people who believe in climate change but are hesitant to act might not and might rather listen to economic research. Above all, the authors argue for honesty in climate communcation: To enhance transparency and trust, it is crucial to incorporate honesty as a fundamental element in sustainability communication. By openly addressing both the positive and negative aspects of sustainability, communicators can establish credibility and foster trust among recipients.‚Äù ([Voci & Karmasin, 2023](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Voci-Karmasin-2023-6446c6c8fedb470290f6c12f1d1b4466?pvs=21), p. 34)

A conceptualisatiomn of the problem of ‚Äúinconvenient truths‚Äù, which goes beyond somple answers or communication strategies is provided by [Irwin, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Irwin-2021-1af841ee9ae2474ca3e02e81a7fe9744?pvs=21). He argues that the problems that our contemporary society is facing cannot be solved by an authoritative delivery of solutions or policies, neither by scientists nor by politicians, nor by exercising dialogue for the sake of policy legitimation. He rather suggests a ‚Äúmove away from sloganising about what is best towards more critical reflection ‚Äì and reflection-informed practice ‚Äì about the relationship between technical change, institutional priorities and wider conceptions of social welfare and justice.‚Äù ([Irwin, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Irwin-2021-1af841ee9ae2474ca3e02e81a7fe9744?pvs=21), p. 155). This approach includes a special attention to the initial framing of an issue, a specific approach to any different instance of communication and, most importantly, a reflexivity towards one‚Äôs own standpoint and the wider consequence of any action, not just communication.
