### From Deficit to Dialogue to Ecosystem and Beyond

Even though science and research has always been communicated to a certain extent, the first major institutional push for public outreach of science was initiated in the early 1980s in Great Britain. Amidst a period of social unrest and uncertainty, public trust in science and institutions was falling dramatically. To compete against this waning trust, in 1985 the Royal society issued a report, titled ‚ÄòPublic Understanding of Science‚Äô _(__[Bodmer, 1985](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bodmer-1985-faf4068aebf14729b72eabd1007321d4?pvs=21)__),_ which determined the general direction of science Communication - in the UK and beyond - for the next decades. The report explicitly calls for scientists to engage in science communication on the premise of a knowledge deficit, or a knowledge gap, on the side of the public. This perceived knowledge gap results on the one hand in lacking public support for matters of science and technology in general, and on the other an incapability of the public to make informed decisions without adequate scientific knowledge, for instance regarding science policy. Scientists, on the other hand, even though they have retreated from public debate due to the lack of support, are conceived as willing to ‚Äòeducate‚Äô the public [(](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?LBfrCm)[Sturgis & Allum, 2004](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Sturgis-Allum-2004-44c516d235ea4efe920760612deda8f9?pvs=21)). The general assumption, and also the underlying rationale for more science communication of the Bodmer report is therefore, that if people were more educated, public support for science would rise and people would make decisions on the basis of scientific reasoning. Also in the US, scholars called for the need of ‚Äòscientific literacy‚Äô in order for policy decisions to be taken: ‚Äúif this communication is to continued and expanded so that the science policy process can function effectively, there must be an audience capable of understanding both, the substance of the arguments and the basic processes of science‚Äù ([Miller, 1983](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Miller-1983-fd30eb7ad0614f5c97ff85d48d1b1de1?pvs=21)). This basic understanding of a knowledge gap that _just_ needed filling in order for the public to make better decisions, would determine the basic characteristics of science communication for a long time. Well until into the 2000s, this _deficit model_ was the premise for most science communication efforts [(](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?jfD2sw)[Seakins & Hobson, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Seakins-Hobson-2017-b6589e0591814755a6c090a940819b74?pvs=21)). However, it was already criticized early on for its linearity and ineffectiveness by STS scholars like Brian Wynne ([Wynne, 1992](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wynne-1992-beb46b724e2149b9bda1b2beccf4e8bd?pvs=21), [Wynne, 1995](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Wynne-1995-e5f031b1dbf3437a90d06b18ca90129c?pvs=21)) or Stephen Hillgartner ([Hilgartner, 1990](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Hilgartner-1990-eca5a736eb13469b99438fee92a79e60?pvs=21)). They argue that in this model, the information flow is only conceived as one-way and that the role of the publics is merely a passive one which should not have any influence on science whatsoever. Also, the notion of knowledge of the Deficit model was criticized as being too narrow and uniform. For instance, controversies, local knowledges, and other reasons for the public to refuse scientific knowledge are not taken into account in the deficit model.

In the face of public controversies in the 1990s like the BSE crisis and the debates over GMOs in agriculture, also mainstream science communication started to recognise the shortcomings of the deficit model and acknowledged the ‚Äúmood for dialogue‚Äù ([Trench, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Trench-2008-37d61677206e42c6b00c6bbd1e8ebfd9?pvs=21), p. 120), which had already been there for some time. The emerging _dialogue model_ aimed to harness the benefits of greater public involvement in decision making and policy processes of scientific and technological issues: The information flow between science and the public was no longer seen as unidirectional and the participation and feedback of the public to science was encouraged and facilitated with different formats. Also the perception of ‚Äòthe public‚Äô changed somewhat in this new model. Laypeople were no longer conceptualized as being incapable of providing valuable input but rather to be able to make decisions and give advice to scientists; but only after a deliberative process together with science, meaning after scientists have provided the information that the public requires. Hence, the new focus of science communication in the heyday of the dialogue model was to facilitate this dialogue and participation process. Deliberative formats, like the Danish citizen conferences were established to work towards consensually oriented debate on scientific controversies [(](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?2qjR5Q)[Seakins & Hobson, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Seakins-Hobson-2017-b6589e0591814755a6c090a940819b74?pvs=21)) and implement policies based on this deliberation process. However, the participatory model, especially the deliberation concept, in which decision making is achieved only if there is consensus on an issue, also has its shortcomings and was criticized by several fields of research. First of all, it harbors some residual assumptions of the public being in need of the ‚Äòcorrect information‚Äô, which are in most formats provided by the organiser in a top-down manner, usually already with an outcome in mind [(](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?K29weF)[Trench, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Trench-2008-37d61677206e42c6b00c6bbd1e8ebfd9?pvs=21)). Another critique aims at the deliberative process itself and its implication for scientific citizenship. In an idealized space, deliberation happens in a hierarchy-free manner but in practice this can never be achieved as hierarchies outside of the group and - often unconscious - biases cannot be left at the door when entering a deliberative format. Additionally, as mentioned above, the way how these formats are organized, also has tacit governance effects on the process. Hence, the format inevitably favors certain views of science and the public over others, often those that are in agreement with the organisational body‚Äôs aims and structure. Because of its orientation towards consensus decisions, the deliberative process is especially unfavorable towards minority views that don‚Äôt hold much discursive power, and who might be affected more by certain policy decisions than the majority who are dominant in the deliberative process ([√Årnason, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/rnason-2013-2ad56054964d436f9ff068ff0eb582ac?pvs=21)). Hence, also the dialogue model of science communication and the discursive formats which were fostered by it also have had their shortcomings.

Since the turn of the millennium, not only science communication and outreach efforts themselves have multiplied and diversified, but also research on science communication has gained a lot more influence and traction, in the field of STS, as well as with practitioners. Also the perspective on science communication as a discipline of academic research, and especially the perceived linearity of the field, turning from deficit to dialogue has been questioned [(Irwin, 2006)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?beyZ0R). At the same time, research on science communication has been broadened by taking into account different disciplines like media studies ([R√∂dder, 2012](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/R-dder-2012-40dd40218cce4f4c8ec5ef4a7cad165a?pvs=21), [Weingart, 1998](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Weingart-1998-de4e416408f9422c84e08eb57c46ccf9?pvs=21)), political sciences ([Chilvers & Kearnes, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Chilvers-Kearnes-2016-10e2cf11b8324bd3bbbd405fdc61d782?pvs=21)) or education sciences ([Baram-Tsabari & Lewenstein, 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Baram-Tsabari-Lewenstein-2017-82c9c849f49941d7b25b344d0e26af5a?pvs=21) [Tytler et al., 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Tytler-et-al-2021-f1b5c3eba12a47a0bac4dda9dcd11d29?pvs=21)). Notably, a large part of emerging concepts surrounding public understanding of science and the practice of science communication are heavily influenced by STS research in various ways. There are some fundamental frameshifts in the conceptualization of science communication caused by STS, which are persistent throughout these different concepts. First and foremost, under the influence of STS, science and the public are no longer seen as separate entities but as parts of the same larger society. This especially shifts the view on scientists and their role in the interaction with the public in contrast to the deficit- and the dialogue model. In the former, scientists are conceptualised as impartial providers of scientific information whereas in more recent models, they are seen as active citizens with viewpoints, biases and networks of their own [(](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?oBx0Zp)[Michael, 2002](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Michael-2002-625681b819244a1cb459bb9044e90a5d?pvs=21)). Other notable impacts of STS research include the growing acknowledgement of the diversity and amorphous nature of science communication ([Trench & Bucchi, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Trench-Bucchi-2021-0810838c41e54c49bdcb3276d76b8c8e?pvs=21), [Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21)), as well as closer attention to the particularities of science communication, such as the temporality and materiality of interactions (for instance [Michael, 2002](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Michael-2002-625681b819244a1cb459bb9044e90a5d?pvs=21)). Also immaterial aspects, like affective and relational interactions and most notably emotions, have been more and more in the focus of contemporary research on science communication ([Davies, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-2014-c73fb0863940425b9274aa7ebc45b7c0?pvs=21), [Davies, 2019](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-2019-5844a7901e1b414e9f8fb1388dda697a?pvs=21), [Zahry & Besley, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Zahry-Besley-2021-95fab04149a14cdfa836aa1d114930b9?pvs=21)). Hence, in the stream of contemporary science communications, there are many small currents. In this context, conceptualising science communication as an ‚Äòecosystem‚Äô in which a multitude of interactions are taking place simultaneously shaping each other in a symbiotic, or even antagonistic manner, help to grasp the complexity of the subject while not losing track of the particularities of single interactions: Contemporary science communication ‚Äúis an ecosystem, where there are many and various forms of life, interacting with each other through multiple means. We have also suggested that no single analytical or theoretical approach can do justice to this diversity. No one methodological lens can be used to look at every kind of science communication from university PR to science theater or science blogging. Instead, scholarship of science communication needs to draw on different disciplinary and conceptual traditions and resources.‚Äù ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21), p. 214).

In summary, science communication, as well as research on science communication, initially framed as starting from a deficit-model-assumption and moving to a more dialogue centred approach, has expanded and diversified in the last years. It has become an ‚Äòecosystem‚Äô in which numerous interactions take place. To research a specific niche in this ecosystem, one has to both look at the particularities and allowances of said niche and choose the ones research methods accordingly while keeping in mind the influences and interactions with the rest of the vast ecosystem.

### 2.1.2 The ‚ÄòGrand Narrative‚Äô of Science Communication and the Deficit Model Lurking in the Shadows

In the previous paragraphs, I have described the development of science communication from a deficit-model to a more dialogue-oriented process to a multitude of different streams and influences. This description suggests a rather linear development of the field. However, this narrative of science communication itself needs to be examined in a critical light.

In science communication, both with practitioners and researchers, there seems to be a ‚Äúgrand narrative‚Äù ([Trench, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Trench-2008-37d61677206e42c6b00c6bbd1e8ebfd9?pvs=21), p. 119) about the development of the field, starting from deficit and turning to dialogue and beyond. In many aspects, the description of this linear development is part of the story that the science communication community wants to tell itself ([Trench, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Trench-2008-37d61677206e42c6b00c6bbd1e8ebfd9?pvs=21)). A closer look reveals that the development of the field is far less straightforward and unidirectional, and that many contemporary science communication efforts are still centered around a ‚Äúframework of one-way transfer of information‚Äù ([Davies, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-2008-6dcd36880364429181d6f88ebe1dff35?pvs=21)), in other words a deficit-model approach. Several studies reveal the continuing prevalence of the deficit model in science outreach activities, especially when it comes to communication, done by the (natural-) scientists themselves ([Besley & Nisbet, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Besley-Nisbet-2013-fff87210186681cbb6d3e70d77ab0472?pvs=21), [Davies, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-2008-6dcd36880364429181d6f88ebe1dff35?pvs=21), [Ecklund et al., 2012](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Ecklund-et-al-2012-a924a55e8f8c4aa7bdb8f16bcfd034a6?pvs=21), [Grand et al., 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Grand-et-al-2015-fb54ad89cadf45859ac505b67a8e01f3?pvs=21), [Simis et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Simis-et-al-2016-005b289a764340a18c974ce39b5b0a1f?pvs=21)). In group discussions with scientists and engineers, Davies (2008) found, that for the involved scientists, communication in a majority of discourses to the public in principle is still ‚Äúsilently constructed as being about what science has to say‚Äù, implying that both, the public is not seen as being able to provide valuable input into the communication process and that communication to the public is framed as in danger of being misinterpreted or misused. However, amongst this main tendency to hold a deficitary assumption of the public, there are secondary discussions amongst some of the scientists, which frame communication activities in a more nuanced way, emphasizing the complexity, different contexts and framing the communication efforts rather as a debate by the scientists. Notably, mainly scientists who had already some experiences in outreach activities seemed to engage these secondary discussions. According to Simis and colleagues (2016), there are multiple reasons for scientists to retain this concept along the lines of the deficit model. Firstly, the emphasis on rationality and rational thinking of the natural scientist‚Äôs education prompts them to believe that the public would follow an argument, just because it is rational. Secondly, institutions favorr communication along the deficit model because it is simpler to implement and therefore more cost effective. Thirdly, since most scientists lack training in communication, sensibilities about the audience or the delivery are not a given. For most researchers in the natural sciences, the public or society is still conceived as apart from the scientific community and not as part of society as a whole (one of the main premises of the deficit model). The authors also found that particularly scientists, who have negative views about the ‚Äòsoft sciences‚Äô, such as sociology, tend to favor the deficit model and communicate accordingly. Other studies ([Golumbic et al., 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Golumbic-et-al-2017-04f2a839f8d74a7f93b0eb1dcf48981e?pvs=21)) found that the same principle can apply to scientists engaging in citizen science. Even though scientists actively participate in citizen-science projects, many are not convinced that the engaged publics could make a meaningful contribution to their scientific research or are concerned about ethical issues or issues of data quality ([Riesch & Potter, 2014](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Riesch-Potter-2014-820e46309c8c42e1bbd681946f67a71f?pvs=21)). According to Golumbic et al. for the scientists engaging in citizen science, the endeavor is predominantly seen as a vehicle to boost public support and secure funding. In other words, the scientists want to appear as engaging and dialogue-oriented towards the public but do not think that an exchange can be beneficial for their knowledge production.

Many of the studies that bring up the issue of scientists harboring a deficit-model understanding of the public when engaging with it, point out similar solutions to this problem. Some argue for formal training of the scientists in science communication with a special focus on social science concepts ([Golumbic et al., 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Golumbic-et-al-2017-04f2a839f8d74a7f93b0eb1dcf48981e?pvs=21), [Grand et al., 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Grand-et-al-2015-fb54ad89cadf45859ac505b67a8e01f3?pvs=21), [Grand et al., 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Grand-et-al-2015-fb54ad89cadf45859ac505b67a8e01f3?pvs=21), [Simis et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Simis-et-al-2016-005b289a764340a18c974ce39b5b0a1f?pvs=21)), also with the help of professional mediators ([Chilvers, 2013](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Chilvers-2013-c41bca15e635493284e910beccc773fe?pvs=21), [Simis et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Simis-et-al-2016-005b289a764340a18c974ce39b5b0a1f?pvs=21)). What most studies suggest however, is more exposure of the scientists to different audiences - and more practice in communication activities ([Davies, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-2008-6dcd36880364429181d6f88ebe1dff35?pvs=21), [Golumbic et al., 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Golumbic-et-al-2017-04f2a839f8d74a7f93b0eb1dcf48981e?pvs=21), [Simis et al., 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Simis-et-al-2016-005b289a764340a18c974ce39b5b0a1f?pvs=21)), such as engaging in citizen science: ‚ÄúExposing scientists to public engagement and citizen science concepts, especially at early stages of their scientific career, could help overcome barriers and encourage scientists to further engage the public in such initiatives'' ([Golumbic et al., 2017](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Golumbic-et-al-2017-04f2a839f8d74a7f93b0eb1dcf48981e?pvs=21), p. 1). More exposure to science communication could potentially also lead to a more nuanced discourse in the scientific world about the audience and the very nature of science communication, giving more space to framing it rather as a debate, as complex and context-dependent, hence assigning more agency to the audience [(](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?olwqwL)[Davies, 2008](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-2008-6dcd36880364429181d6f88ebe1dff35?pvs=21)). However, even though the concept of more exposure equals more dialogue has been proposed repeatedly it has hardly been investigated in greater detail.
