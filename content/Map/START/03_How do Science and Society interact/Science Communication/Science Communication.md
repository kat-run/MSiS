**Abstract/Summary**

As long as people have been engaging in scientific pursuit, they have also communicated their research to non-scientists in some form or the other. From the carefully selected audience of ‚Äògentlemen‚Äô who witnessed Boyle‚Äôs air pumps in action ([Shapin & Schaffer, 1985](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Shapin-Schaffer-1985-7abf6c1c6e084670ae1b8991c0b135d1?pvs=21)) to the efforts of Louis Pasteur and his networks to harness his microbes to ‚Äòpasteurise‚Äô the French public ([Latour, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Latour-1988-39b602db5e2b42f6907766b3222cd9f7?pvs=21)), science has always reached certain publics who themselves are not involved in the scientific pursuit. The field of science communication, both in theory and in practice, is a vast and multidisciplinary endeavor. There is a vast community of scientists, who have an interest in communicating their research to the public, there is a growing number of professional science communicators; but there is also a growing community of researchers who dedicated their career to research about science communication. Since the field is so heterodox in nature, [Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21) propose to frame it as an ecosystem: ‚Äúit has many niches in which different practices of communication sustain themselves and others in a complex web of interdependence and autonomy‚Äù ([Davies & Horst, 2016](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Davies-Horst-2016-d7ce925c7b334648a32b78f31367dcaa?pvs=21), p. 6). Because of its complexity and connectivity, this node is - even more than the others- not to be understood as complete or static. The ‚ÄúHandbook of Public Communication of Science and Technology‚Äù [Trench & Bucchi, 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Trench-Bucchi-2021-0810838c41e54c49bdcb3276d76b8c8e?pvs=21)) provides a deeper glance at the variety of topics that concern contemporary science communication scholars.
