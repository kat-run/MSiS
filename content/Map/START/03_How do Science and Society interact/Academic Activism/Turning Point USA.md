- Capitalism is the most moral and proven economic system ever discovered.

**National Field Program**

The National Field Program is dedicated to supporting students on campuses daily through setting up tables, engaging in face-to-face conversations, distributing educational literature, registering new student activists, and hosting campus events. TPUSA currently employs over 350 full- and part-time staff dedicated to recruiting new activists, registering voters, and becoming major leaders of the movement in their community.

TPUSA has established a presence on over 3,500 campuses covering all 50 states, and has built a substantial network of the next generation of supporters, activists and leaders. Each semester, Charlie Kirk embarks on a nation-wide campus tour to challenge the status quo and encourage free thinking -- something too often neglected on college campuses today
