Abstract [Gardner et al., 2021](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gardner-et-al-2021-840062221d18440c94f7e325d9449534?pvs=21)

Thousands of universities have made climate emergency declarations; however the higher education sector is not rising to the collective challenge with the urgency commensurate with scientific warnings. Universities are promoting an increased focus on sustainability through their research, teaching and their own institutional footprints. However, we suggest that such initiatives will be insufficient to catalyze the required transformations in our societies and economies because of (i) the time lags inherent in education and research pathways to impact, and (ii) their failure to address either real-world political processes or the forces invested in maintaining the status quo. We therefore suggest that academics should move from publications to public actions and engage in advocacy and activism to affect urgent and transformational change. We discuss the barriers to engagement in advocacy that academics face, and propose a number of actions that universities should adopt to help overcome them. These include explicitly recognising advocacy as part of the work mandate of academic staff by altering work allocation models, facilitating engaged research sabbaticals, altering hiring and promotion policies, and providing training to enhance the effectiveness of engagement. In addition, universities must defend the right of academics to engage in protest and push back against emerging threats to academic freedom. Such actions would strengthen a rich tradition of academic protest and enhance the contribution of universities to the public good in areas well beyond sustainability, for example race and social justice (Black Lives Matter, decolonising education) and public health.

Abstract [Isopp, 2015](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Isopp-2015-0c66b964c2f641f2a3157979bbb57276?pvs=21)

This commentary explores a traditionally supposed boundary between science and politics, with particular attention to activist scientists who engage in public communication. Work in fields like science and technology studies shows that framing this boundary in terms of epistemological rules fails. Boundaries dictating proper scientific activities are at best pragmatic, context-dependent, and fluid. Certainly, certain kinds of politics can undermine the integrity of scientific knowledge, but it is imperative to recognize that all science is political. As we see with activist climate scientists, certain scientific knowledge carries far-reaching political consequences. It is thus problematic to call for the ‚Äúde-politicization‚Äù of science or science communication. A turn from epistemic to ethical concerns perhaps offers a more constructive way forward.

Abstract [Bengtsen, 2022](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bengtsen-2022-33c905b913db47e09506d147c052105e?pvs=21)

In this essay, I argue that the meaning of academic activism focusing narrowly on direct, immediate, political, and visible forms of action and agency needs to be supplemented by a more nuanced understanding including dimensions of academic re-action, co-action, and inter-action. In universities today, we are witnessing an entrepreneurial turn of research environments with an ever-increasing focus on the roles of professionalization and employability in researcher education and careers. As a counter-view, the essay aims to open up the conceptual understanding of the interconnectedness between research and its societal contexts. I shall argue that these relationships cannot exhaustively be described through current discourses about societal impact but need a broader and more inclusive vocabulary including terms like societal engagement, societal responsibility, societal value, and societal dialogue and commitment. I shall work from a philosophical foundation in the critical realism of Roy Bhaskar coupled with recent discussions within the literature of academic activism.

Abstract [Zourou et al., 2024](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Zourou-et-al-2024-9b5ec31ee55a4d5ebf0b653388fe6932?pvs=21)

Activism, as a manifestation of citizen engagement for social purposes, can be practiced by individuals and communities alike, such as communities of professionals and, in this case, professionals in academia. Academic activism is a novel form of socio-political engagement in scholarly communities. Recently, communities engaged in academic activism have multiplied, mostly due to the climate emergency and increased awareness on human-induced climate change. This paper focuses on the learning elements and self-transformative potential of becoming an academic activist. This is done by analyzing three key areas: (a) the perceptions of self, (b) the learning component, and (c) the educational component, namely teaching the very activities that activists carry out at their universities. To serve these objectives, we conducted eight semi-directive interviews during the summer of 2022 in which participants drew upon their personal experience and life trajectories in their journey to becoming academic activists. Using a Discourse Analytical framework, we scrutinized the semantic fields summoned and the discursive spaces mobilized by the interviewees. The findings of this study highlight the participants' determination for activism, depicting it as a conscious act, a duty. Moreover, three types of learning have been depicted, demonstrating the wealth of learning trajectories experienced. The potential impact of academic activism on teaching practices (societal role of education) has also been depicted.
