This page provides useful information on how to navigate the map as well as some reflections on the limitations of the mapping process. It should be read before diving into the map itself.

### Structure and Areas

The Map is structured around central questions, which at large should reflect the questions put forward in the research proposal. The Questions can be expanded during the mapping process:

### Reflections: Completeness

Any cartographer has to make decisions regarding the scope, the content and the level of detail of their map. By making

Therefore, before diving into the map, the obvious has to be made explicit: A map of Science in Society can never be complete. Science, Society and politics are such complex fields and are entangled to such a large degree, that it is hard to set them apart, which would also not make sense from an analytical point of view. Surrounding these areas, there is an enormously large body of research spanning several disciplines from science and Technology Studies over Philosophy of Science to Political Science and beyond, that one researcher could not collect in a lifetime. Additionally, the fields are very dynamic and new research areas are added constantly. Also, as society and the political landscape change, science changes with it. Hence, one could spend years researching the topic and then would have to start again at the beginning because of the rapid development of the field.

Therefore, this map feels neither a mile wide, nor an inch deep, but barely touches the surface. In the course of this mapping project, I tried to be as broad as I can be while still providing some detail to issues that are crucial for the understanding of the whole picture or that are simply interesting and/or thought-provoking. The selection of these topics was done with as little ideological considerations as possible, nor with a specific goal in mind as the original research questions were deliberately kept very broad. Also the visual shape of the map, besides the very basic skeletal structure of the guiding core-questions, was not planned on a drawing board but rather grew organically. However, in the course of the research process, some interesting questions/controversies emerged, which subsequently gave some degree of detail to the areas that were crucial to explaining them. So the research process was not fully unidirectional as the research progressed. I also cannot claim that the selection is objective or unbiased. I talk about this issue in depth in the next section.

### Reflections: Bias

just as any cartographer needs to make decisions on which information to include in a map and which to leave out, they have to reflect on their own biases and locate themselves within the map.

The map that i have assembled during this research project, is a map of the dynamic and complex system that I, as a researcher, inhabit and also shape to a certain extend. Therefore it is important that I make this involvement and my specific vantage point available to the users of this assembled body of research. The guiding influence in this line of thinking is Donna Haraway’s work on _Situated Knowledges_ which I will briefly sketch in the next paragraphs_._

The concept of **Situated Knowledges** was developed as a response to the need for a new approach to understanding and addressing the realities and objectivities of our world, particularly within the context of "the belly of the monster"—the United States in the late 1980s ([Haraway, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haraway-1988-bc4549584d3f4daa8117480681e655b8?pvs=21), p. 581). Donna Haraway, along with other feminist scholars such as Sandra [Harding, 1986](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Harding-1986-8ee8b4014e0044b78f31049e1f329152?pvs=21), recognized that the traditional conceptualization of scientific knowledge is trapped in a fundamental dilemma. Early research in Science and Technology Studies (STS) has demonstrated that knowledge and scientific 'facts' are not simply uncovered or discovered; rather, they are constructed through a social process ([Latour, 1987](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Latour-1987-da8a1206342844669b30bf87a3ac0267?pvs=21)). This construction is often influenced by specific perspectives that have historically shaped science—namely, those that are western, male, and white. However, these perspectives conceal their origins behind what Haraway refers to as the "god trick" (Haraway, 1988, p. 581), meaning the puorported ‘objectivity’ of scientific knowledge.

However, reducing the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of reality solely to a power struggle or a desire to separate sciences from the non-scientific world is only of limited utility for living in a knowledge society and finding truths about the world. Therefore, Haraway criticizes approaches like the Strong Program ([Bloor, 1991](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Bloor-1991-0f5fa5ce0df14433b3aba222b65ba3b9?pvs=21) [1976]) and the concept of Boundary Work ([Gieryn, 1983](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Gieryn-1983-7b14f244c0a046a2aa8046e139fd20d0?pvs=21)) because, while they highlight flaws in the established scientific system, they fail to provide a pathway out of the dilemma. This dilemma involves acknowledging the social processes and power dynamics inherent in scientific knowledge while still being able to "get to know the world effectively by practicing the sciences" ([Haraway, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haraway-1988-bc4549584d3f4daa8117480681e655b8?pvs=21) p. 577), a necessity in our current technoscientific world.

This issue is particularly pressing for those who are already marginalized: “It has seemed to me that feminists have both selectively and flexibly used and been trapped by two poles of a tempting dichotomy on the question of objectivity” ([Haraway, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haraway-1988-bc4549584d3f4daa8117480681e655b8?pvs=21), p. 576). Haraway resolves this dilemma by advocating for a different standpoint: Situated Knowledges. By perceiving the world from a partial perspective and situating one’s knowledge in a specific context, it allows us to retain a claim to reality without resorting to the god trick of asserting superior and impartial knowledge: “We need the power of modern critical theories of how meanings and bodies get made, not in order to deny meanings and bodies, but in order to build meanings and bodies that have a chance for life” (([Haraway, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haraway-1988-bc4549584d3f4daa8117480681e655b8?pvs=21), p. 580).

In this spirit of constructing new knowledge from a distinct vantage point, claims about the world and the pursuit of knowledge gain value only when the standpoint from which they are made is considered. This perspective intrinsically links the subject and object of research, thereby increasing the researcher’s responsibility for their work: **“Feminist objectivity is about limited location and situated knowledge, not about transcendence and splitting of subject and object. It allows us to become answerable for what we learn how to see”** (([Haraway, 1988](https://lean-sphynx-49b.notion.site/Haraway-1988-bc4549584d3f4daa8117480681e655b8?pvs=21), p. 583). In this redefined notion of objectivity, accountability becomes paramount. As researchers, whether in sociology or biomedicine, we bear responsibility for the objects of our study. Our specific vantage points connect us to these objects, urging us to extend greater care and reflection toward them. This approach may also prompt us to recognize broader connections and implications in our research.

The map of Science in Society, that lays the groundwork for this research project, is thus inherently situated. Even though I try to be as unbiased as possible and follow guidelines for good scientific practice (which should be a given), my _situatedness_ is reflected in the map. It influences the issues that I raise, the content, the connections and the cited literature. My specific vantage point is that of a researcher with a background Science and Technology Studies, who specialized in research on science communication and the lives and struggles of scientists within the epistemic system. I also have lived experience from the field of biomedical research, which evidently shaped my view on the current epistemic system and the struggles of researchers within it. I am convinced that science and a career in the sciences is a meaningful pursuit and the search of new knowledge is important for our society, especially considering the numerous challenges that our contemporary society faces today and in the future. I am also deeply partial to the idea that science and technology should be accessible for everybody and that discrimination in any form is a contradiction to the very idea of science. Consequentially, I inadvertently emphasize the discriminations that I, as a woman from a non-academic and working-class background, have faced, and am therefore sensitized to, while other discriminations, for instance based on ethnicity, are certainly not represented as much. Also my geographic standpoint in the global north is heavily reflected in the map, being both the system in which i was socialized and in which a majority of research on the topics is published.

By acknowledging these standpoints, I try to give the user context with which the map is better suited to be a useful research. Hopefully users of this research can use it from their vantage point and, to some extend, make it their own.
