Welcome to the online-application of the project " Mapping Science in Society", carried out between May and November 2024.

Here are some basic instructions:

- You can dive right into the content by clicking on "Map" on the left hand side. By clicking into a node, you should see the node and their immediate connections appear in the window on the right. If you click on the network-icon in the graph view on the right, you can see a graph of the whole map. 

- If you want to know more about the project and how the map is structured, you can first read the legend.

- All the sources are collected under "Bibliography", if you click on a source within a page, you are directed to an entry, providing further information. 

I hope, you find the content enlightening and that I with this map, I could "construct keys before which reality springs open"(Adorno) ðŸ˜Š
